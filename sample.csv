Bommai Kalyanam,R. M. Krishnaswamy,[[K. V. Mahadevan]],[[Sivaji Ganesan]]<br />[[Jamuna (actress)|Jamuna]]<br />[[Mynavathi]],"Suryam (Kannan in Tamil) is a playful teenage boy, in the cusp between puberty and adolescent, the son of the famous and well-to-do lawyer Perayya (Varatharajan in Tamil) and Parvathamma (Thangam in Tamil). While playing football, he meets Radha, the daughter of a well respected freedom fighter family of Simhadri (Veeramuthu in Tamil) and Seshamma (Maragatham in Tamil). At first sight both fall in love.

Perayya is a modest man, but Parvathamma is a greedy woman. Parvathamma wishes to marry off Suryam to her brother Chalamayya's (Sonachalam in Tamil) and Bhadramma's (Perundevi in Tamil) daughter Bullemma (Kannamma in Tamil) and invites them to her place. Bullemma is a naïve girl and Thimaiyya (Mannar in Tamil), Bhadramma 's brother loves her. Perayya likes the simplicity of Simhadri's family and agrees on the alliance of Suryam and Radha. When Parvathamma opposes this, Perayya , in order to carry on with the wedding, lies to her that Simhadri will present a large dowry. The wedding takes place.

After the wedding, Bhadramma, who is furious that Bullemma is not the bride, instigates Parvathamma to query regarding the dowry. A scuffle takes place between the two families and Parvathamma wishes to send back Saroja to her parents place, but Suryam sides with Saroja and accepts her whole-heartedly. Meanwhile, Chalamayya wishes to leave home, but Bhadramma , who is in agony, decides to stay back and plans to create hatred between Parvathamma and Radha. In turn, Parvathamma tortures Saroja in every possible way, but Saroja fights back and keeps calm. Matters get worse when Perayya dies, but not before seeking a promise from Suryam not to disobey Parvathamma. Suryam and Radha's marriage life hits a roadblock. When coming to know that Parvathamma treats Saroja very badly, Simhadri steps in and takes Radha, who is driven away by both Parvathamma and Bhadramma, away to his place.

When Suryam comes back, Parvathamma and Bhadramma lie to him that Saroja had gone to her parents place along with Simhadri, without seeking their consent. That night, Saroja tries to meet Suryam, but Parvathamma would not let Saroja in. Meanwhile, Bullemma unwittingly lets know Suryam regarding this incident and Suryam goes to Simhadri's place to explain, in order to take back Radha. Simhadri spells out to Suryam clearly that Saroja would not go to Suryam's place as long as Parvathamma is there. Taking this opportunity, Parvathamma and Bhadramma force and arrange Bullemma to be married to Suryam. Observing all this, Chalamayya and Thimaiyya attempt to abduct Bullemma, but fail. To make matters worse, Parvathamma sends a letter to Saroja informing that Suryam would remarry and restricts Saroja not to interfere in Suryam's life any more.

On the engagement day, Suryam who is badly disturbed by the events, falls from the first floor of his balcony and is badly injured. Upon hearing this, Saroja rushes to Suryam's place, was stopped by Simhadri , but later consents after hearing to Radha's plea. Suryam is happy to see Saroja around, tells her not to leave him even though Parvathamma mistreats her and Saroja assures this. At this juncture, Parvathamma and Bhadramma further humiliate Simhadri to the worst, which drives him to sell his mansion to compensate with much dowry. Parvathamma tries all her best to drive Saroja away, but to no avail and she becomes violent. Saroja hides in one of the rooms, but Parvathamma tries to force open the door, when the door collapse onto Parvathamma. At the same time, Simhadri parades the dowry items from his home throughout the streets, much to the residents' dismay and reaches Suryam's place. Upon seeing all this, Bhadramma and Bullemma flee.

Parvathamma realises her error on her deathbed and seeks apology from Suryam, Saroja and Simhadri then dies. Suryam and Saroja reunite and live happily."

Rama Rao<br /> [[Sivaji Ganesan]]<br />[[Jayaprada]]<br />[[Manjula Vijayakumar|Manjula]],"Set in the 4th century BCE, the film narrates the historical tale of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], and his mentor, [[Chanakya]]. The story begins with the Greek invader [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] encroaching upon Indian territories, with Magadha being his ultimate target for conquest. In response to this impending threat, Chanakya, a fearless scholar and strategist, sets out to stop the invasion. He recognizes the potential in Chandragupta, a talented fighter and the son of Mura, a discarded wife of the Nanda ruler [[Mahapadma Nanda]].

Unbeknownst to this, Chandragupta arrives in [[Pataliputra]] determined to confront the tyrannical Nanda princes who oppress the people. In Pataliputra, he begins to rally support against the nine arrogant Nanda princes and faces the cunning Chief Minister Rakshasa, who quickly recognizes Chandragupta’s true potential. Aware of Chandragupta's identity, Rakshasa seeks to apprehend him, fearing his claim to the throne.

As tensions rise, Mura arrives at Pataliputra, where she confesses to Chandragupta his royal heritage, explaining her past with Mahapadma Nanda. Despite his initial outrage, Chandragupta ultimately accepts Mura's revelations. During this period, he develops feelings for Aasa, Rakshasa's daughter, who, unaware of their familial ties, aids him in escaping from captivity.

Simultaneously, Chanakya infiltrates the royal palace, attempting to awaken the Nandas to the dangers they face. However, his efforts result in severe mistreatment at the hands of the Nandas. Vowing to annihilate the Nanda dynasty, Chanakya becomes a target for Rakshasa, who attempts to assassinate him. Chandragupta intervenes, securing Chanakya’s safety and solidifying their alliance. Chanakya recognizes Chandragupta as the rightful heir and the only candidate capable of becoming emperor.

Following their alliance, Chanakya employs various strategies to fortify Chandragupta's position. He arranges for Chandragupta to form a friendship with the tribal king Parvataka, promising to make his daughter, Chhaya, the future empress. Meanwhile, Rakshasa employs deceitful tactics to undermine their rebellion, including plotting Chandragupta's demise and creating a secret passage between the fortress and Chanakya's hideout. Furthermore, he manipulates Aasa, exploiting her affection for Chandragupta and turning her into a dangerous adversary.

As the narrative progresses, Alexander arrives on the Indian subcontinent, escalating the conflict. Aasa's love for Chandragupta intensifies, prompting Chanakya to remind him of his purpose through his mother, Mura. Motivated by this, Chandragupta confronts and defeats Alexander in a climactic duel, compelling the invader to retreat and acknowledge the bond between mentor and disciple.

Following their victory, Chanakya uncovers Rakshasa's plot regarding the secret tunnel. Employing strategic maneuvers, Chandragupta launches a counter-offensive, ultimately conquering Magadha. In a pivotal moment, Chanakya executes the Nanda rulers, allowing Chandragupta to ascend the throne and establish the Maurya Empire in honour of his mother, Mura. However, Mahapadma Nanda, enraged by his family's downfall, attempts to assassinate Chandragupta after Mura's death, ultimately taking his own life in despair.

As Chandragupta prepares to celebrate his victory and union with Aasa, Chanakya reveals her true identity and heritage, leading Aasa to make a self-sacrifice for the greater good. In the film's resolution, Chanakya secures Rakshasa's loyalty and appoints him as Chandragupta's Chief Minister, ensuring that his wisdom will guide the new empire. The film concludes on a hopeful note, with Chanakya crowning Chandragupta, signifying the dawn of a new era under the Maurya Empire."

On receiving news of a robbery in his territory, he and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers. When captured, the robbers confess that they had been hired by the [[British Raj|British]] to create unrest in Kattabomman's domain; the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain, [[Ettappan]], to help them annexe Panchalankurichi.

Vellaiyammal, who lives in [[Sayalgudi|Chayalkudi]], a village near Panchalankurichi, vows to marry the man who tames her pet bull. She brings her bull to Panchalankurichi for participating in a [[jallikattu]] game sponsored by Kattabomman. All those who attempt to tame the bull fail until Vellaiyathevan, Kattabomman's commander-in-chief, subdues the bull and wins Vellaiyammal's love. Kattabomman later learns of their love, and encourages them to marry.

The king receives a message from W. C. Jackson, the tax collector for [[Tirunelveli]], which demands a meeting with him at [[Ramanathapuram]] to discuss payment. Captain Davison, Kattabomman's British friend, advises him to see Jackson. Jackson, learning that Kattabomman has come with his troops, demands to meet him alone. At the meeting, Jackson insults him and orders him arrested. Surrounded by British troops, Kattabomman fights and escapes; however, his minister Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai is captured.

Some time later, Pillai is released and brings news that Jackson has been sent back to England at Davison's recommendation. A British messenger sent to Kattabomman's court by Colonel S. R. Lushington, Tirunelveli's new revenue collector reports that Pillai and his men have looted their granaries and killed their men at [[Srivaikuntam]]. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men to do it because of the famine in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's action, Kattabomman accuses him of theft and murder. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead, he offers money to compensate for the looted rice. Lushington refuses the compensation and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops; he and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sundaralingam informs the king, who prepares for war.

On the day of the battle, Vellaiyammal begs Vellaiyathevan not to go because she had a nightmare full of evil omens the previous night. Ignoring her entreaties, Vellaiyathevan sets out and is killed in the ensuing battle. When she learns of her husband's death, Vellaiyammal avenges him by killing the man who killed him. She finds Vellaiyathevan's body and, overcome by grief, falls dead across it. Bannerman's troops attack Panchalankurichi with heavy artillery, and Kattabomman's army suffers. The king, wounded in the neck, is saved by his brother [[Oomaithurai]]. Sensing that the fort cannot survive another cannon barrage, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to the adjoining kingdom of [[Kovilpatti]].

He and Neela, a promising defence attorney, are engaged to be married. Neela's brother, Ramesh is a public prosecutor who is supportive of her career and love. Ravi is questioned by the police when one of his clients, Jayaraj, is murdered. Ravi was one of the last people to see Jayaraj alive but has no useful information to assist the investigation. He does, however, have trouble remembering very basic information from a short time ago. This, in addition to his increasingly painful headaches, leads him to see the doctor. He's diagnosed with brain tumours. Ravi is eligible for an operation to remove these but is told that there may be life altering side-effects. Ravi also learns that Jayaraj's brother Ramaraj is offering a large reward for information leading to the capture of his brother's murderer.

Feeling bereft, hopeless and worried about the financial future of his family, Ravi anonymously calls in a tip naming himself the murderer. He arranges for the reward money to go to his mother using lawyer Lakshmanan as arbiter without revealing himself to anyone. Ravi is arrested by the inspector. Neela tries to defend him but Ravi sabotages his own case and is sentenced to death. While in jail, he collapses due to his tumour and is operated on. He survives with no side-effects and finally realises the true magnitude of his actions. He will be hanged for a murder he did not commit. Ravi reveals the truth to his family and friends but Neela advises him that at this point, nothing short of producing the actual murderer will help him. He sets out to find the murderer and his investigation leads him to Michael D'Souza, a robber who had robbed Jayaraj shortly before his murder. With Michael's help, Ravi unravels the mystery of Jayaraj's murder."

Neela Vaanam,[[P. Madhavan]],[[M. S. Viswanathan]],[[Sivaji Ganesan]]<br />[[Devika]]<br />[[Rajasri]],"Babu has the tendency to use hitchhiking as his transportation method to reach his workplace, Shanthi Theatre. He asks Vimala, a stranger, to drop him off at Shanthi Theatre. At first, she misunderstands that he is a movie freak, as he says that he watches three shows in first class in Shanthi theater. Then she realises that Babu is a ticket taker in the Shanthi theater. They meet every day, and they fall in love, and Babu tells her that they can only marry if he gets a good job for his qualification, a Bachelor of Arts. Prakash sees Babu and Vimala together in a swimming pool, and he informs his uncle Varatharajan. Varatharajan approves of Vimala's love.

Somanathan, a paper mill owner, asks Sharma to look for a groom for his only daughter, Gowri. Gowri is a naive woman; she meets Babu on the road as he approaches her car, misunderstanding Vimala's car. She drops him off at his house, invites him to her house for her birthday party, and offers to get him a job at her father's company. Babu attends Gowri's birthday party, hoping he will get a job, where Gowri introduces him to her father, Somanathan. Babu tells Gowri that Somanathan is the one who helped him finish his education. As other guests are approaching, Somanathan goes upstairs. Gowri's mother notices that Gowri's diamond necklace is missing, and the people around them search for the necklace. Sharma notices Babu holding his coat tightly, so Sharma and other people remove his coat and laugh at him for not wearing a shirt. Somanathan scolds others for mistreating Babu. Somanathan and Gowri visit Babu in his house and ask for forgiveness for the mistreatment, and they offer him a job in their mill, which Babu accepts.

Babu informs Vimala that he got a job in Somanathan's paper mill, and then she introduces him to her father Varatharajan. Sharma finds Prakash as a groom for Gowri. Gowri is afraid of injections and surgery; she hides her stomach pain, but her mother notices her suffering, and they get her to the hospital and find that she has uterine cancer, which can't be cured. Gowri's parents hide it from her, and Somanathan tries to find a way to cure her, but his attempts go futile as every doctor says there is no cure and she can only live for five or six months. Varatharajan rejects the proposal for Prakash and Gowri's marriage, as he has heard from Sharma that Gowri may have been possessed by a ghost. As Gowri hears that she has been rejected by Prakash's family, she is sad and disappointed, which Babu notices, and he tries to make her feel better, but she ends up proposing to marry her. Somanathan notices Gowri's interest in marrying Babu, and he talks with him alone to explain Gowri's situation, and he begs him to marry her.

Babu and Gowri get married and live happily. Vimala thinks that he left her only for Gowri's money. As Somanathan's health is not good, Gowri and Somanathan ask Babu to take care of the mill. Vimala becomes friends with Gowri and gets a job as a personal assistant in Somanathan's paper mill. Babu is shocked to see Vimala at the office, and she threatens him by saying she will reveal their past relationship to Gowri.

When he reaches his house, Babu scolds Gowri for hiring Vimala, which makes Gowri cry, so he tries to make her laugh. She feels the pain in her stomach. He tries to convince her to see a doctor, but she is hesitant, saying that if doctors come, they may do surgery, which may lead her to not have a child. So to make her let a doctor check her, he lies that she may be pregnant; that's why she feels the pain. The lady doctor checks and informs Babu that Gowri will only live for four or five months, so let her be happy, making her believe she's pregnant. Somanathan and Babu pretend like Gowri is pregnant, and they hide their sadness.

Five months later, Babu notices the news that a conference is happening in Delhi and doctors across the globe are attending the conference, so he attends the conference to try to find a way to cure her. He returns to Madras, and Vimala asks him why he has gone to Delhi and accuses him of cheating another woman like he did to her. Also, she shows the photograph of Babu and Vimala together, and she threatens him by saying she will show the picture to Gowri. He snatches the photo from her and tears it apart. One of the pieces of the photo falls on the fruit basket, and when he is home, Gowri finds the photo piece. Sceptical, she visits Vimala, and she tells her that she is afraid that Babu has a past relationship with someone, and by seeing Gowri's innocence and her love for her husband, she writes that she will no longer be in Babu's life in a photo's backside, and she leaves the place. By reading the written message, only she realises that Vimala is the one with whom Babu has been in a relationship.

When Babu is back at the house, Gowri confronts him and says that she has found his secret. Unwitting what she meant, he tells her about her medical condition. He tells her that his recent visit to Delhi was only to attend the medical conference. He explains the situation to her and convinces her to get treated. When the ambulance arrives, she gets pain again, and she refuses to get in as she wants to die in his arms. She tells him to marry Vimala, and she gives him the baby doll, which she considers their own child, while taking her last breath. Somanathan asks Babu not to leave, but he leaves the house with the doll. On the road, Vimala finds Babu with the doll, and she begs that she understand his innocence, but he walks away."

He works as a sub-registrar, and his jovial nature earns him the friendship of nearly everyone he meets. In the house near where he lives, a poor family consisting of a widowed mother and several children reside. Vidhya is the sole breadwinner of the family, while her younger brother Vijay is looking for a job. Her older brother left the home after a love-marriage and is struggling financially. She also has a younger sister, Nandhini, and another younger brother. Dasaratharaman makes it a point to look out for Vidhya as they take the same train to their respective jobs.

Vijay introduces Moorthy to his family as a relative of a friend, and he quickly endears himself to everyone. He promises to help both brothers find jobs and proposes marriage to Vidhya. To the family's joy, the two marry, with Dasaratharaman presiding.

Raghuraman is in love with his colleague, Radha, a determined woman with a forceful personality. Dasaratharaman, unaware of this, asks his friend, VKR, to find a bride for his son. Raghuram plots to trick his father into choosing Radha as his bride, but bad timing ruins his plan. Unaware of his identity, Radha is rude to Dasaratharaman in a bid to put off a marriage she doesn't want. Worried that he will now never approve, she pushes Raghuraman to marry her in secret. Dasaratharaman learns this and arrives in time to see the wedding.

Moorthy, meanwhile, turns out to be a wanted criminal who tricks women into marriage to steal their jewellery. He is arrested and Vidhya's marriage is annulled, leaving her humiliated. When both of her brothers are in need of cash to get a job, Vidhya helps her oldest brother, causing a fracture in the family. The rest of the family moves out, leaving her alone. Feeling guilty for presiding over the marriage, Dasaratharaman keeps an eye on her.

Radha and Dasaratharaman clash repeatedly. Unable to get over the circumstances of his son's marriage, he makes sly comments disparaging Radha to everyone. Radha, in retaliation, is rude to him and insinuates about his relationship with Vidhya. Matters come to a head when Raghuraman learns of Radha's behaviour towards his father and Radha requests Dasaratharaman to leave the home.

In the end, when Vidhya suggests that they should get married as they both need companion and have no one, they go to registrar's office only for Vidhya to find out that he had arranged to adopt her much to the shock of Dasaratharaman's family."

One night he stops at a prostitute's house for the night, then awakens late in the morning. He drives his truck at breakneck speed in thick fog to make up for lost time, drinking once again. He runs over and kills a farmer, but instead of fleeing in a [[hit and run]] opportunity, Raja stays to face the consequences. He is arrested by police and brought before the court.

Raja acknowledges his guilt to the judge who knows that he should be sent to prison for two years. Instead, the judge is moved by the plight of the farmer's family which includes his widow Seetha, a sister, two young children, a weak father and a blind mother. They believe that imprisonment serves no good for the victim or the perpetrator. The judge decides to try a novel experiment by forcing Raja to live with the farmer's family and look after their financial needs. Horrified, Raja tries in vain to convince the judge to change his ruling. Raja is transported to his new ""prison"" under police protection, where he must meet the hostile villagers. The farmer's family abhors his presence and call him a murderer. Raja tries to escape from the family the first night, but is apprehended and brought back to the house to serve his time.

Raja comes to terms with the twist of fate that has forced him to become a subsistence farmer and live under the unforgiving eyes of the farmer's family. Over time, he started sincerely working for the family and its interests. He meets Radha [[Jayalalithaa]], a happy-go-lucky girl who operates a small bi-scope machine to entertain the village kids. They take an instant liking to each other, which blossoms into love. He also finds friends among the previously hostile villagers Ponnamma. Raja works hard on the family land while protecting it from the clutches of a local landlord [[R.S.Manohar]] who has ill-intentioned designs on the land and on the farmer's sister.

Surmounting many obstacles, Raja arranged the marriage of the sister with her childhood sweetheart. With the help of a benevolent police force and the judge, Raja thwarted attempts by the landlord to seize the family's land and that of other villagers who have mortgaged their land with him. The farmer's widow, however, can not forgive Raja for having killed her husband.

Things take a dramatic turn for the worse when Raja is framed and arrested for the accidental death of Radha's drunken grandfather. At the same time, the landlord has the lush harvest produced by Raja and other villagers covertly set ablaze and has Radha kidnapped, primarily to punish Raja. The widow who has been working in the landlord's Ice Factory thinking, he is an honourable man, witnessed the misdeeds of the landlord and finally realised his mistake. She rescues Radha, but is instead trapped by the landlord, who tries to rape her. Meanwhile, Raja stages an escape from his holding cell with the help of Radha, and comes to Seetha's rescue in the nick of time. He confronts the landlord and violently assaults him as payback. The Police show up and arrest the landlord for his role in defrauding the villagers and destroying their harvest.

The deceased farmer's family finally accepted Raja as one of their own and arranged his marriage with Radha. Finally, Raja completed his two years imprisonment successfully. Police arrive to escort him back to town. He asks the judge to let him serve a life sentence, and the judge smiles, justifying that his experiment has been successful. In the end, villagers welcome Raja and celebrate him. The children and the dog reunite with Raja. The family members of the deceased farmer and Ponnamma are reunited. Furthermore, Radha and Raja are united."

Andha Naal,[[S.

The next morning, Rajan, a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found shot dead by his own handgun in his house in Madras after his neighbour, Chinnaiya Pillai, having heard the gunshot, informs the police. Purushothaman Naidu, a local police inspector, arrives at Rajan's house and starts investigating the death.

[[Criminal Investigation Department (India)|Criminal Investigation Department]] (C.I.D.) Officer Sivanandam joins Naidu to help with the investigation. Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who killed Rajan for the money found at the crime scene. However, Sivanandam is unconvinced by Naidu's theory because the amount of money at the scene matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room. Rajan was about to leave Madras in anticipation of the bombings.

The two policemen question five people in and around Rajan's house, most of whom are his family members or friends. The first to be questioned is Rajan's wife Usha, who is unable to speak because of her grief. Sivanandam and Naidu feel embarrassed and are reluctant to question her further. They begin interrogating Chinnaiya, who proposes that the killer is probably Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother, and recalls a confrontation between them: Pattabi asked for his share of the family property but Rajan refused his request, feeling that he and his wife would squander it. Chinnaiya concludes that this may have prompted Pattabi to kill Rajan.

When Sivanandam and Naidu interrogate Pattabi, who feels remorse for Rajan's death, he admits that he did not treat his brother well nor understand his good intentions. He recounts an incident in which his wife Hema fought with Rajan because he refused to apportion the property. Pattabi says Hema could have killed Rajan for the money as she loses her sanity when overpowered by anger.

Sivanandam leaves Naidu to interrogate Hema. She is initially impudent and refuses to give a statement about the crime, but she later agrees when Sivanandam threatens to arrest her husband. She reveals Rajan's extramarital affair with Ambujam, a dancer who is pregnant with his child. As Rajan treated the news of the pregnancy with a reckless attitude, Hema suggests that Ambujam could have killed him. When questioned, Ambujam accuses Chinnaiya of murdering Rajan, saying Chinnaiya was her foster father and wanted her to stay away from Rajan after the three met during a picnic. As their relationship continued, Chinnaiya became frustrated and wanted to end the affair.

Sivanandam interrogates Usha, who tells him how she and Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky [[fountain pen]] to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspects{{mdash}}including Usha{{mdash}}must pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. Chinnaiya, Pattabi and Hema shoot him as instructed, but Usha fails to do so and bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth.

Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He then became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him, and then cried at his boots later, holding them.

Sivanandam and Naidu ask Usha for the papers Rajan used to hatch the bombing plan. After she goes to Rajan's room to fetch them, Sivanandam tells Naidu that Usha's fingerprints which he collected and the ones on Rajan's boots matched, which led him to suspect her, and her failure to shoot during the exercise confirmed his suspicion. When Usha takes a long time to come back, the two hear a moment's silence followed by a gunshot, run into Rajan's room and Sivanandam screams, ""Usha!""."

When Saravanan gets some firm clues that a reputed local businessman and philanthropist 'Lion' Dayanidhi could be the kingpin behind the cartel, Dayanidhi has him killed by one of his henchmen. Soon after, a distraught Sivaraj, who is desperate to find those behind his son's murder, is introduced by a retired jail superintendent friend to a ferocious criminal lodged in Vellore prison named Sangili who remarkably resembles his son Saravanan in appearance.

Sivaraj decides to reform and train the brutish Sangili to impersonate Saravanan in order to trace those behind Saravanan's death. Sivaraj finds transforming Sangili a seemingly impossible task as Sangili refuses to mend his ways and has his own agenda of seeking revenge against his sister's murderer but eventually succeeds with some help from Ganga and Saravanan's kids.

Alongside, he also falls in love with Ganga's friend Anandhi and befriends a local don named Rajali who offers to help him in need. 

Just before his death, Saravanan had scribbled the word 'No17' on a doctor's prescription pad to help identify his killer and Sangili pursues the clue diligently but in vain. While attending a New Year's Eve party hosted by Sivaraj's friend 'Lion' Dayanidhi, Sangili stumbles on to the fact that they had been misreading the clue upside down and Saravanan had actually scribbled the word 'Lion' to implicate Dayanidhi.

Sampoorna Ramayanam (1958 film),K. Somu,[[K. V. Mahadevan]],[[N. T. Rama Rao]]<br />[[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]],"The film is the complete [[Ramayana]]. It begins at [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]] on [[Solar dynasty]]’s present ruler [[Dasharatha]]. He is perturbed as childless so he conducts [[Putrakameshti]] on ordinance of Sage [[Vashishta]], with his 3 wives [[Kausalya]], [[Sumitra]] & [[Kaikeyi]]. Here, [[Vishnu]] with [[Shesha]] Shanku & Chakra incarnated as his 4 sons: [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], & [[Shatrughna]]. Parallelly, while tilling the ground, [[Janaka]], the king of Mithila, finds the box enclosing the baby whom he rears as [[Sita]]. Time passes, Saint [[Vishvamitra]] arrives and seeks to send Ramalakshmana for the protection of his Yaga. Soon, he endorsed them with powerful armaments, which they used to destroy [[Tataka]] & [[Maricha]] [[Subahu]] and accomplish the Yaga.

Meanwhile, Janaka announces [[Svayamvara]] to Sita when Vishvamitra moves in with the sibling. Amid, Rama transforms a stone form of [[Ahalya]] into normal. Here, the challenge is to affix the world-renowned bow of [[Shiva|Siva]]. However, [[Ravana]] lands therein without an invitation but fails and gets humiliated. All at once, Rama breaks it when enraged [[Parashurama]] confronts him but realizes he is his continuation and backs up. After the wedding of Sita & Rama, Dasharatha announces Rama's crowning ceremony, which immerses Ayodhya. Begrudged Mandhara sly maid of Kaikeyi poisons her to seek her husband, the two boons at the time of the Devasura war. Dasaratha offers to do so, and Kaikeya forces Bharata's crowning and Rama's exile for 14 years. The heartbroken Dasaratha accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama also deliberately accepts his father's reluctant decree and proceeds with Sita & Lakshmana.
[[Guha (Ramayana)|Guha]] crosses them, the [[Ganges]]. After that, Dasaratha dies when Bharata backs and flares up on his mother, which makes her regret. Bharata rushes to retrieve Rama but denies obeying his father's words. So, Bharata obtains his sandals as a gesture and starts ruling Ayodhya.

After 13 years, Rama moved to Panchavati, where Ravana's sister, [[Shurpanakha]], entices him, and Lakshmana cuts off her nose & ears. Being aware of it infuriated Ravana ploys to seize Sita with the aid of the Maricha, who turns into a golden deer. Entranced by its beauty, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it when he chases it, leaving Lakshmana as a guard. Rama shoots it and mimics Rama before dying. Frightened, Sita forces Lakshmana to go, which he obeys but stipulates not to cross the chalk outline he drew. Ravana, in the guise of an ascetic, abducts Sita. [[Jatayu]] tries to arrest Ravana but loses his wings. Ramalakshmana learns about the fatality via him.

Ongoing, they meet an ascetic [[Shabari]], who directs them toward [[Kishkindha]]. So, they step in and befriend [[Hanuman|Anjineeya]] & [[Sugriva]]. Rama kills his malice brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vaali]] and crowns him. Then, [[Vanara]] are under the hunt of Seeta. Anjineeya crosses the sea and reaches Lanka, locking Seeta in Ashoka Grove. Here, he bestows the ring and states Rama will take revenge for her insult. Plus, he takes her golden hairband, who returns by setting fire to Lanka and warning Ravana. With the aid of Vanara, Rama constructed a stone bridge over the sea and reached Lanka. [[Vibhishana]], a good Samaritan Ravana's brother, requests him to pardon Rama. As a result, he is ostracized and propitiates with Rama, who promises to bestow Lanka.

The war begins, which destroys most of the demon warriors. So, Ravana awakes his second sibling [[Kumbhakarna]], who is too slaughtered by Rama. Here, [[Indrajit]] creates an illusion of Sita's assassination when Rama faints. Now Lakshmana takes charge and collapses by Indrajit's ""Nagastram."" Anjineeya secures him by ""[[Sanjivani (Hinduism)|Sanjeevani]]"" and he kills Indrajit. Ultimately, Ravana walks to battle when Rama disarms & asks him to arrive tomorrow. The following day, Ravana confronts him with his ten heads. Rama kills Ravana by getting knowledge of his death secret from Vibhishana. Next, Rama asks Sita to undergo an ""Agni Pariksha"" test of fire to prove her innocence, as he wants to eliminate the rumors surrounding her. Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, and Agni raises Seeta, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her fidelity. At last, Rama backs Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana, Anjineeya, and other Vanaras. Finally, the movie ends happily with the Rama's coronation."

*[[K. B. Sundarambal]]}}","The [[Hindus|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] gives a sacred mango fruit, brought by the sage [[Narada]], to his elder son [[Ganesha|Vinayaka]] as a prize for outsmarting his younger brother [[Kartikeya|Muruga]] in a competition. Angry with his father, Muruga (dressed as a hermit) goes to [[Palani]]. He meets [[Avvaiyar (Sangam poet)|Avvaiyar]], one of his devotees, along the way. Despite her attempts to convince Muruga to return to [[Mount Kailash]], he remains adamant about his decision to leave his family. His mother, the goddess [[Parvati]], arrives there and tells the stories of four of Shiva's divine games to calm Muruga.

The first story is set in [[Madurai]], the capital city of the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya Kingdom]]. Shenbagapandian, the king, wants to find the answer to a question posed by his wife (whether the fragrance of a woman's hair is natural or artificial), and announces a reward of 1,000 gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. Dharumi, a poor poet, desperately wants the reward, and starts to break down in the [[Meenakshi Temple, Madurai|Meenakshi Amman Temple]]. Shiva, hearing him weeping, takes the form of a poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's [[Royal court|court]] and recites it; however, the court's head poet [[Nakkīraṉãr|Nakkeerar]] claims that the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy and burns him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Realising it was Shiva's will that Dharumi should get the reward, Nakkeerar requests Shenbagapandian to give it to Dharumi.

The second story focuses on Shiva marrying [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]] against the will of her father, [[Daksha]]. Daksha performs a ''[[Yajna|Mahayajna]]'' without inviting his son-in-law. Sati asks Shiva's permission to go to the ceremony, but Shiva refuses to let her go because he feels that no good will come from it. Sati disobeys him and goes, only to be insulted by Daksha. She curses her father and returns to Shiva, who is angry with her. Sati says that they are one; without her, there is no Shiva. He disagrees, and burns her to ashes. He then performs his [[Tandava]], which is noticed by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], who pacify him. Shiva restores Sati to life (who is reborn as Parvati) and accepts their oneness.

In the third story, Parvati is banished by Shiva when she is momentarily distracted while listening to his explanation of the [[Vedas]]. Parvati, now born as Kayarkanni, is the daughter of a fisherman. When she is playing with her friends, Shiva approaches in the guise of a fisherman and tries to flirt with her. The fishermen are troubled by a giant shark who disrupts their way of life, and Shiva says that he alone can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (who is the bull deity [[Nandi (mythology)|Nandi]] in disguise) and marries Parvati.

The last story is about Banabathirar, a devotional singer. Hemanatha Bhagavathar, a talented singer, tries to conquer the Pandya Kingdom when he challenges its musicians. The king's minister advises the king to seek Banabathirar's help against Bhagavathar. When the other musicians spurn the competition, the king orders Banabathirar to compete against Bhagavathar. Knowing that he cannot win, the troubled Banabathirar prays to Shiva—who appears outside Bhagavathar's house in the form of a firewood vendor the night before the competition, and shatters his arrogance by singing ""Paattum Naane"". Shiva introduces himself to Bhagavathar as Banabathirar's student. Sheepish at hearing this, Bhagavathar leaves the kingdom immediately and leaves a letter for Shiva to give to Banabathirar. Shiva gives the letter to Banabathirar, and reveals his true identity; Banabathirar thanks him for his help.

After listening to the stories, Muruga realises that this too was one of Shiva's divine games to test his patience; he then reconciles with his family. The film ends with Avvaiyar singing ""Vaasi Vaasi"" and ""Ondraanavan Uruvil"", in praise of Shiva and Parvati."

With five younger sisters to support, he takes on menial jobs to provide for his family. Captain Chidambaram, a retired army officer, owns a cycle shop in the same village and rents a portion of his house to Subramani. Chidambaram is a well-wisher of Subramani's family, and his eldest sister even works part-time at the cycle shop. Subramani's mother arranges for his eldest sister to marry a mute groom, citing the absence of dowry demands. However, Captain Chidambaram intervenes, advising the eldest daughter to wait for a more suitable match rather than settling for an unsatisfactory arrangement.

Subramani gets into a physical altercation with a manager during an interview, leading to a court case. Fortunately, Captain Chidambaram comes to his rescue, arguing on his behalf and securing his release. The family's poverty takes a toll on Subramani's fourth sister, who hesitates to inform her family about her puberty, fearing the additional financial burden. Meanwhile, Subramani's cousin, who harbors feelings for him, provides clandestine support. However, her family proposes that Subramani leave his family and live with them, a condition he refuses, ultimately leading to his cousin's marriage to someone else. Unbeknownst to his family with Captain Chidambaram's help, he embarks on a journey to [[Madras]] to seek employment opportunities. In Madras, he encounters a young woman who poses as a police officer and convinces him to stay nearby. However, she is later revealed to be the daughter of Chidambaram's friend. Subramani first tries to break into the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film industry]] as an actor but faces rejection. He then ventures into smuggling, only to meet with failure once again.

Once Subramani saves Chidambaram's friend's daughter from a group of miscreants, she eventually develops feelings for him. However, Subramani does not reciprocate her emotions. To maintain the illusion that Subramani has secured employment, Captain Chidambaram discreetly sends money to his family through money orders, with the help of postman Ponnusami. Chidambaram suffers a heart attack but refuses surgery, opting instead to allocate the funds to support Subramani's family. Meanwhile, the struggling Subramani is found lying unconscious on the street but is rescued by Chidambaram's friend's daughter. She offers him work in the film industry as a junior artist for a daily wage of Rs.25. Captain Chidambaram suffers a second heart attack, prompting him to transfer his properties to Subramani's mother's name. He also makes arrangements to provide a monthly stipend to Subramani's family, making it appear as though the support is coming from Subramani himself. Also, he builds his own grave and expresses his unwavering faith in Subramani's future success.

At the film shoot, Subramani impresses director [[Bharathiraja]] with his improvised dialogue, so he appoints Subramani as the film's hero and writer. Subramani's career as an actor takes off, and he achieves great success. On Bharathiraja's sister's advice, Subramani moves into Bharathiraja's house. Meanwhile, Captain Chidambaram, on his deathbed, requests that Subramani not be informed about his condition, asking his family to let Subramani focus on his career. After the film's success, Subramani arranges marriages for his three sisters. He also accepts the love of Chidambaram's friend's daughter. However, during the wedding ceremony, Subramani discovers that his sisters are not interested in marrying the groom Subramani had chosen as they were motivated by money. 

Subramani then realizes that his sisters are actually in love with three other men: a tailor, a laundry man, and Postman Ponnusami. These men had helped Subramani during his struggling days and were willing to marry his sisters without demanding any dowry. Subramani wholeheartedly accepts the three men as his brothers-in-law and agrees to their marriages."

He is famous for living with prestige and is a keen observer of status in all matters. Sridhar is married while Murali is looking for a job. With his hard earned money, Padmanabhan buys his ancestral house, sold earlier due to poverty and names it ""Vietnam Veedu"" (Vietnam House) because of the constant tiffs among the family members, similar to the [[Vietnam War]]. His major problem is that he is unable to come to terms with his children's behaviour. He retires from his job, is unable to accept the situation, and gets worried about how his sons will manage the family. Added to this, they spoil his ""Prestige"" image.

Sridhar, who accepts bribes at his work place, is arrested by the police after a search of their home and subsequently loses his job. Murali takes a loan from a moneylender and does not repay it. Hence, the moneylender lands up at Vietnam Veedu and demands repayment from Padmanabhan. The neighbours come to know of these happenings and mock him for living with false prestige. Padmanabha feels dejected; only Savithri empathises with him. He fears that after his death, his children will not take good care of their mother.

Padmanabhan's constant worry leads to a serious medical problem; his family doctor advises him not to get overexcited. Padmanabhan undergoes a surgery after which the doctor says that though he is fine now, he may not be able to take any exciting news, as his heart is weak. Now all the family members are reconciled with each other and take good care of him. Padmanabhan soon receives a letter from his previous employer offering him the post of director, for which he would be required to go abroad for training. Reading this, he is overjoyed that he is still revered by many for his ethics and honesty, but due to the resultant excitement he dies."

When he returns four years later, he is shocked to see that his mother Vedhavalli is a widow and was told that his father Sambasivam committed suicide due to the disgrace that he was unable to pay back the loans.

Sundaram leaves to Bombay for an interview, where comes across the murder of broker Govindan and is shocked to see that the murderer is Punniyakodi, who is later introduced as Gomathi's father in a police investigation. Sundaram helps Punniyakodi to escape and in turn is suspected by the police instead. Police Superintendent Raja is appointed to investigate the murder case. When Gomathi's uncle refuses to let her marry Sundaram, she leaves home, following Vedhavalli to Madurai. Sundaram travels back to Madras where he bumps into a certain Susila on the road. Sundaram finds Govindan's family and offers help, who initially refuses but later accepts when persuaded and explained to. While leaving Govindan's house, Sundaram learns that Punniyakodi is living as a fugitive, had changed his name as James and staying with a crook Kanthan. Sundaram seeks his friend Dass's help in taking care of Punniyakodi for the time being, goes to Madurai and explains to Vedhavalli and Gomathi that he is a murderer and wanted by the police, but Vedhavalli refuses to accept Sundaram as her son due to the conviction.

Sundaram, upon reading an advertisement in the newspaper, joins as a tuition teacher in disguise as Kalamegam. There, Sundaram learns that Susila's father is Justice  Somanathan, her cousin is Inspector Raja, servants Arasan and Kanniyamma. Meanwhile, Superintendent Raja hatches a plan to move Vedhavalli and Gomathi to Dass's house so to ease the capture Sundaram if he happens to visit them, but James leaves Dass's home following Kanthan's temptation. Susila refuses Raja's advances and develops a soft corner for Kalamegam, but later learns that he is Sundaram and his deeds, but lies to Justice Somanathan that he is a good man. Susila also lets Sundaram escape when Raja finds out about this.

Vedhavalli, who is a staunch believer of justice, hates Sundaram for his conviction and arranges for Gomathi to marry Daas, but Gomathi refuses. In turn, Gomathi pleads to Sundaram to marry Susila as Susila had helped them out a lot to prove Sundaram's innocence before getting shot by the police, mistaken for Sundaram. A trial takes place where Sundaram accepts all the charges against him. A twist in the story occurs when Somanathan produces Punniyakodi and Kanthan in court. Punniyakodi admits in court that he was cheated by Kanthan into shooting broker Govindan, where Kanthan earlier had told Punniyakodi that the revolver was unloaded. Lastly, Punniyakodi admits that he is actually Sambasivam and was introduced as Punniyakodi to the police by Sundaram, who was only doing all these in order to save him. The judges sentence Kanthan for murder, further trials for Sambasivam and six months for Sundaram. At the end of the story, Sambasivam applies Kungumam to Vedhavalli at the request of Sundaram."

Vijayakumari]],"Zamindar Sivalingam is married to Lakshmiammal and takes his family's prestige and heritage very seriously. Dancer Sulochana and Lakshmiammal have baby girls at the same time in the same hospital.

Sivalingam is not in town at the time of the delivery and his close friend Ramaswamy takes care of Lakshmiammal. When the babies are taken for cleaning by the nurses, there is a short circuit and both nurses die. There is no way of identifying the babies. Sulochana who was abandoned by her husband, leaves the hospital. The doctor brings both babies to Lakshmiammal and she is not able to identify her baby either.

Sivalingam arrives and seeing both babies in the room assumes he has twins. Knowing how important the family line is to him, Lakshmiammal, Ramaswamy and the doctor don't tell him the truth. Both girls, Chandra and Kantha grow up as the zamindar's daughters. Sulochana's brother, Nadaraj, who learns that his niece is growing up in Sivalingam's household and faced with the same confusion, takes up Lakshmiammal's offer and stays on there as a caretaker. Meanwhile, Lakshmiammal and Ramaswamy's wife, Parvathi, who are childhood friends promise to get their children married to each other.

Chandra has a birthmark which is said to be very lucky, but is by nature more like her Lakshmiammal. Kantha is more like Sivalingam. Chandra falls in love with her classmate Shekar. Since he is the son of his wealthy friend, the late Mohanasundaram, Sivalingam agrees to the wedding.

Ramaswamy, who lives lavishly and who is careless in his business matters, faces severe business losses and approaches Sivalingam to back him in business matters. Sivalingam promises to give him money, but refuses to let him use his name or claim his acquaintance. He also gives a job to Sundaram in one of his factories, but refuses to have any further contacts with their family.

When Ramaswamy and Parvathi hear that Chandra's engagement is fixed, they attend the function uninvited. Sivalingam insults them and Ramaswamy is driven to reveal that one of his daughters is not his own. The doctor who was also present there needs to confide too. The engagement is stopped and the family is thrown into confusion. Due to this, Shekar's mother (Rukmani) forces him to leave the place.

Sivalingam refuses to talk to his family or the children and becomes extremely disturbed. Chandra tries to solve the problem by leaving the house. She gives a lady called Maragatham her ring to act as the dancer Sulochana. Maragatham goes to Sivalingam's house and says that her daughter can be identified by means of a birthmark.

The police arrive with some jewels and a suicide note from Chandra and they realise that she is now dead. Sivalingam is very happy when he finally becomes convinced that Kantha is his real daughter and fixes her marriage with Shekar. Lakshmiammal is very disturbed because she believes that all the confusion in the house was caused because they did not keep their word to Ramaswamy and Parvathi and get one of the daughters married to Sundaram.

Kantha wants to humiliate Sivalingam, whose conceit caused Chandra's death and she made Lakshiammal practically bedridden. She refuses to marry Shekar and says that she will marry Sundaram. Meanwhile, Nadaraj, who was thrown out of the house by Sivalingam, traces Maragatham through the ring that she tried to pawn and the family is again thrown into confusion.

Meanwhile, Chandra, who attempts suicide by jumping into a river is saved by the students of an ashram. They persuade her to stay on as a teacher to the orphan students and she agrees. Shekar who is now an Education Inspector comes to the school and sees her. The principal, however, convinces him that she is an orphan girl who always lived in the ashram.

Shekar then narrates the story of Chandra and also tells the principal that her sacrifice was wasted because Maragatham confessed the truth. He also tells her that both Sivalingam and Lakshmi are bedridden and that Kantha is struggling to care for both parents. Chandra wants to go back home, but makes up her mind to move away instead. She requests a transfer. Nadaraj overhears the principal and Chandra talking and is realises that Chandra is alive. He tells Sivalingam and Lakshmiammal and they set out in search of her.

Chandra's taxi hits Sivalingam and he is admitted in the hospital. Both daughters give him blood and he understands that character is more important than family's prestige and heritage. Sivalingam who had turned over a new leaf accepts both Chandra and Kantha as his daughters. Finally, Chandra marries Shekar and Kantha marries Sundaram as both Sivalingam and Ramaswamy reunited."

Chidambaram, along with Siva, is invited to Tirunelveli by the District Collector, Winch. The collector directs them not to engage in political activity and also orders them out of the District. They defy the orders and are arrested. In the trial which ensues, Chidambaram is sentenced to 20 years life imprisonment and Siva to 10 years. Chidambaram's sentence is reduced to six years on appeal. The imprisonment of these two leaders sparks off mass unrest which is put down ruthlessly. Some time later, the new District Collector [[Robert Ashe (civil servant)|Ashe]] is shot dead by a patriotic [[Vanchinathan]], who commits suicide before the police can reach him.

The news of the unrelenting struggle outside gives much consolation to Chidambaram and Siva who are treated barbarously in the prison. Chidambaram emerges from the prison a broken man only to witness a series of disappointments&nbsp;– Chidambaram's brother has become insane, Siva is a victim of [[leprosy]] contracted during his term in prison, people have forgotten him and his role in the Indian independence movement, the National Shipping Company is bought by its British rival and leaders like [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] and [[Subramania Bharati|Bharathiyar]] die one after another. Chidambaram devotes the last years of his life to the study of literature and dies still dreaming of the day when India would be free."

Puthiya Paravai,Dada Mirasi,[[Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy]],Sivaji Ganesan<br />[[B. Saroja Devi]]<br />[[M. R. Radha]]<br />[[Sowcar Janaki]],"Gopal is a rich businessman ''en route'' to India from Singapore on a [[cruise ship]]. He meets Latha, another traveller who has been accompanied by her father Ramadurai. Gopal and Latha find that they like each other, so Gopal invites them to stay at his mansion in [[Ooty]], which they accept. One day, Latha discovers that Gopal becomes agitated whenever he sees an onrushing train and demands to know why. He explains that the reason behind this is his first wife.

Gopal recalls that, after losing his mother, in sorrow he had been wandering aimlessly at Singapore. He fell in love with Chitra, a nightclub singer, and they married in the presence of her brother Raju. But to Gopal's dismay, Chitra always came home inebriated, and despite his repeated requests, had little respect for tradition and family values. When Chitra showed up drunk for Gopal's birthday party, he tried to control her, but she refused to co-operate; Gopal's father died of a heart attack after seeing Chitra's behaviour. Irritated by Gopal, Chitra later tried to leave him; he caught up and begged her to change her decision, but Chitra berated him for controlling her, and he slapped her. Later that night, he heard that Chitra committed suicide on a railway track, and this hurts him a lot. Latha sympathises with Gopal and accepts his love.

The engagement of Gopal and Latha is fixed. While the reception is being held at Gopal's mansion, a woman claiming to be Chitra arrives, accompanied by her uncle Rangan. Gopal's engagement with Latha is cancelled after Rangan convinces everyone that the woman is indeed Chitra. Gopal says she is an impostor and shows Chitra's death certificate as proof, but Rangan reads in the certificate that though the corpse was disfigured beyond recognition, Gopal insisted that it was Chitra so it was declared to be her. Rangan's actions convince Gopal's police officer friend Kumar, although Gopal is adamant that his wife is dead. ""Chitra"" and Rangan become disruptive and Gopal gets frustrated, fearing that Latha might leave him because his ""wife"" has turned up.

After many failed attempts to expose the impostor, Gopal reveals the truth to everyone: when he slapped Chitra, not knowing she was suffering from a heart condition, she died immediately. Gopal realised that he had inadvertently killed his wife. To avoid arrest, and safeguard the honour of his family, he manipulated the murder to appear like a suicide on a railway track and fabricated the necessary evidence to show that Chitra committed suicide.

With everyone believing his story, Gopal orders Kumar to arrest the Chitra impostor. However, Latha reveals herself as a police officer investigating Chitra's death based on the complaint filed by Raju, who suspected she could not have committed suicide. Ramadurai is Latha's senior posing as her father, Rangan is the local investigating officer, and the Chitra impostor is Rangan's aide, Sarasa. Together, they staged an entrapment to get the killer's confession because there was no clinching evidence. Latha confesses to a dejected Gopal that though she initially pretended to love him, his good nature impressed her and she truly loves him; she promises that she will wait for him till he returns after completing his jail term. Gopal is relieved, but is still arrested."
Padithal Mattum Podhuma,[[A. Bhimsingh]],[[Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy]],[[Sivaji Ganesan]]<br />[[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]]<br />[[Rajasulochana]]<br />[[K. Balaji]],"{{Long plot|date=May 2016}}
Raju and Gopal are cousins who are very attached to each other. Gopal, the son of a [[zamindar]] and Mangalam, is uneducated, rough and loves hunting. Raju is the orphaned son of the zamindar's elder brother, raised by the zamindar and Mangalam as their first son, is educated, well mannered and cowardly.

The zamindar and Mangalam plan to get Raju and Gopal married and they seek the marriage broker Kailasam. Kailasam, a [[Shaivism|Saivite]] is married to Andal, a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] and they have a daughter ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]). The couple often quarrel pertaining the difference between their beliefs which provides comic relief.

Kailasam suggests that Raju be married to the educated and wealthy Meena, daughter of Rao Bahadur and Gopal to be married to uneducated, country girl Seetha, sister of farmer Moorthy and daughter of a widow. It happens that the zamindar and Mangalam are unable to visit the brides' place, Kailasam arranges that Raju visit Seetha and Gopal to visit Meena. Gopal learns a few English words from Raju before leaving to Rao Bahadur's place. Rao Bahadur and Meena were impressed with Gopal and mistakenly conclude that he is well educated. A. Karunanidhi, who is the servant of Rao Bahadur, serves Gopal. At the same time, Raju sees Seetha and was very much impressed with her deeds and wishes to marry her.

Raju, who is a coward and unable to express himself to the zamindar and Mangalam, hatches a wicked plan by writing an anonymous poison letter to Rao Bahadur defaming himself as drunkard, womaniser and non-worthy and to Moorthy defaming Gopal as the same. Raju's plan works, where Rao Bahadur is irked by this and plans to have Gopal to be the groom for Menna and Moorthy plans to have Raju to be the groom for Seetha.

Much to Kailasam's persuasion to the zamindar, the wedding takes place where Raju is married to Seetha and Gopal marries Meena. Matters become serious on their first night, where Meena found out that Gopal is uneducated and blames Gopal as a liar for posing as an educated man before her. On the other hand, Raju and Seetha lead a happy life. The next day both couples leave to their in-laws place. Raju has no problems, but Gopal was embarrassed to face Meena's educated friends and leaves home without Meena. Upon reaching home, Gopal lies to the zamindar and Mangalam that Meena had to stay behind in order to sit for examinations. Rao Bahadur and Meena believe that the letter was sent by none other than Gopal, who liked Meena at first sight, cheats them as an educated and would like to have her instead of Raju. When Raju and Seetha arrive back, the zamindar and Mangalam lead them to Raju's father's house where the couples live happily. Gopal gets very much attached to Seetha and accepts her and treats her as his mother. Gopal continues on hunting and is assisted by A. Karunanidhi.

As time moves on, the zamindar calls in Kailasam to find out from Rao Bahadur when is he sending Meena down. Rao Bahadur angrily tells Kailasam and shows him the letter. Kailasam also believes in this and reveals the matter to the zamindar and Mangalam. Furious on hearing this, the zamindar hits Gopal and drives him away, but Mangalam believes that her son is innocent. Upon knowing this, Raju becomes restless and guilty that his deed led to a serious matter and tries to steal the letter from Gopal at night. Gopal wakes up suddenly and unsuspectingly questions, but Raju behaves under the pretext on searching for his books and unknowingly drops the letter on the floor while leaving the room. Seeing the lights were on, Mangalam enters Gopal's room and found out that the handwriting of the letter belongs to none other than Raju and gets very mad. Gopal urges Mangalam on promising not to let anyone know about this. In conjunction with this event, Gopal falls ill and Seetha nurses him back to be healthy again.

Raju and Seetha sets off to Rao Rahadur's place to compromise, where Bahadur's wife insists that Meena reunite with Gopal, but Rao Bahadur and Meena does not give in at all. Kailasam suggests that the zamindar to send a letter to Rao Bahadur stating that should Meena not live with Gopal, he would seek another bride for Gopal to remarry. Rao Bahadur forcefully sends Meena to Gopal's place. Meena, disgusted at the sight of Gopal, hurts him badly with insults. Gopal angrily leaves the room, gets drunk and returns to Meena and when a quarrel broke out again, whips her, which results in her fleeing back to her parents' place. Seetha, in dismay, orders Gopal to apologise to Meena and bring her back. Gopal goes over to Rao Bahadur's place and pleads to Meena to forgive him and to follow him back, but she refuses. Left with no option, Gopal tries to pull Meena forcefully when Rao Bahadur intervenes and hits Gopal badly with his walking stick.

Gopal leaves Rao Bahadur's house with much embarrassment. He is very much humiliated and the feeling of being unable to fulfill Seetha's orders makes him go berserk. On the way back, Gopal goes to the jungle and grabs the rifle from A. Karunanidhi, who is hunting and shoots whatever comes in his path. A. Karunanidhi rushes over to the zamindar's place and informs them of the situation. Raju, who feels guilty feeling that all these problems originated from his stupid deeds, goes over and tries to stop Gopal. In turn, Gopal who is devastated blames Raju for all his miseries. Seetha comes over and is shocked to see that Gopal is pointing the rifle at Raju. Seetha tries to stop him when Raju also tries to prevent Gopal from pulling the trigger, when the rifle shoots, killing Raju and Seetha faints. Before dying, Raju requests Gopal to promise not to inform regarding that he is the one who composed the letter. Gopal is arrested.

Mangalam falls ill and informs the zamindar, Rao Bahadur, his wife and Meena that the letter originated from Raju and not Gopal. Rao Bahadur and Meena feel guilty of their actions towards Gopal all the while and repent. Meanwhile, the public prosecutor proves to the judge that Gopal is guilty. Rao Bahadur and Meena rush to Seetha's home town, but Moorthy understands the situation, but is unable to help as Seetha avoids meeting anyone. Rao Bahadur and Meena plead to Seetha and she agrees to testify in court. Seetha's testimony saying that the rifle was handled by Seetha, Raju and Gopal  unsure of who pulled the trigger, gets Gopal released. Gopal and Meena live happily, while Seetha goes back to her home town."

To earn a livelihood, he migrates to [[Hampi]] along with his wife Kamala and son Madhava. On his way to Hampi, he halts at a [[Kali]] temple where he is initially terrified looking at the goddess' idol and the animal sacrifices made to please her. That night, Kali appears before him and grants a boon: he would have to choose either wisdom or materialistic wealth. Raman opts for both, which angers Kali who warns that he might end up as a clownish poet whose wisdom is solely useful for entertaining others. Raman accepts it as a blessing and requests Kali to save him from further dangers, to which the goddess agrees and disappears.

Raman reaches Hampi and approaches Rajaguru, the royal priest of the Vijayanagara empire to find employment in the court of king Krishnadevaraya. Neither Rajaguru nor his assistants help him and he returns dejected. However, he finds an opportunity when Krishnadevaraya is unable to distribute 17 disputed elephants among three brothers as per their deceased father's will. Raman solves the problem and Krishnadevaraya appoints him as a court member. With his wit and loyalty, Raman soon earns the respect of all the court members, except Rajaguru who sees him as a problem.

The Deccan Sultans of [[Berar sultanate|Berar]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmednagar]], [[Bidar Sultanate|Bidar]], [[Sultanate of Bijapur|Bijapur]], and [[Sultanate of Golconda|Golconda]] decide to wage a war on Vijayanagara empire with united military forces. They send Kanakaraju, a spy, to Hampi where he meets Raman, who happens to be his distant relative. Some days later, Kanakaraju tries to assassinate Krishnadevaraya and Rajaguru blames Raman for giving shelter to a spy. As Raman is about to be killed as per the king's orders, he overhears a conversation between another spy and the court's astrologer. The spy bribes the astrologer to influence Krishnadevaraya in postponing the war on Bijapur so that they can have time for proper preparations. Raman escapes and meets Appaji with whose help he reveals the astrologer's intentions. The astrologer is killed and Rajaguru, who believed in him with good faith, is accused of trying to back stab the king. Raman intervenes and Rajaguru is saved, which improves their relation.

The Bahmani Sultanate then send courtesan Krishna to Hampi. With her acclaimed dancing skills, she manages to elicit the notice of Krishnadevaraya, who finds himself besotted by her wits and sensuousness. He issues orders that anyone who enters his private chamber would be beheaded and continues to spend with time with Krishna for months. Appaji and Raman learn that the Sultans are planning to take advantage of the King's inaccessibility and shall launch a combined attack on Hampi soon. Worried at the state of affairs, Raman braves the prohibitory order and enters  Krishna's abode dressed as a woman, but is ignored and expelled from the kingdom.

Meanwhile, Krishnadevaraya's wife [[Tirumala Devi|Thirumalambal]] falls seriously ill, and he finally realises his mistakes. Once the King is back at his palace, Raman manages to gain entry into  Krishna's chamber again, this time under the guise of a saint who assures her that he would bring the King back to her. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the hidden soldiers to surround her. She kills herself preferring a dignifying death, and Raman wishes to leave for [[Delhi]] to convince emperor [[Babur]] from sending his elephantry to support the Sultanate in the war.

Raman reaches Delhi and meets Babur in the guise of an aged fakir and sings praises of him, until he empties all the gold coins he has. Babur then invites him to his palace to gift him properly. Raman goes to Babur's palace, and introduces himself as one of those innocent citizens of the Vijayanagara empire who shall suffer if Babur extends his support to the unjust Sultanate. Babur is convinced and calls off his elephantry back. Dismayed at the sudden turn of events, the Sultanate call off the war. Krishnadevaraya learns about Raman's efforts in stopping the war from Appaji. Remorseful, Krishnadevaraya invites Raman to rejoin the court, to which he agrees gladly."

To his father's annoyance, he brings with him his westernised girlfriend Bhanumathi, hailing from [[Andhra Pradesh]], to meet his family. Sakthi announces his plan to open a chain of restaurants in [[Chennai|Madras]] and marry Banumathi, which saddens his father as he wanted his son to help local residents with his education. Periyasamy Thevar is a respected village chief whose younger half-brother Chinnasamy Thevar and nephew Mayan Thevar hold a grudge against him. Periyasamy's elder son Muthuvel, though the oldest in his generation, is a drunkard. The entire village suffers from this long-standing family feud. Mayan always tries to outdo Periyasamy Thevar as he believes Periyasamy to have poisoned Chinnasamy into paralysis.

Sakthi, despite reservations about the barbaric behavior persisting in the village, spends time in the village with Bhanu. They find an old temple, built by his great grandfather, that has been closed off due to the feud between Periyasamy and Mayan regarding the first respect from temple. Sakthi insists on entering with the help of his friend and servant Isakki, who breaks open the temple. Mayan hears of this and a riot between the two village factions occurs. To quell the situation,  Periya Thevar contemplates apologising to his opponents. Sakthi feels he or Isakki should apologise instead. Sakthi goes off to drop Banu in the station and he sees the riot as he returns. When Sakthi reaches home and asks for Isakki, he learns Mayan's men have severed Isakki's left arm as punishment for opening the temple. To prevent further escalation of the situation, Sakthi, with his father's permission and with the help of his [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] friends in the government, legally opens the temple for all.

Slighted by this, Mayan hires goons to break a dam protecting a part of the village that supports Periya thevar. The goons use explosives to damage the dam, flooding half of the village and resulting in numerous deaths, including infants. This saddens Sakthi, who spots the goon who placed the explosives and gives chase. After capturing the goon, Sakthi hands him over to the police. The goon does not mention Mayan's involvement in fear for his own family's safety. Seeing the plight of the villagers, Sakthi changes his mind and decides to stay back with maya thevar. Weeks later, Mayan uses his clout to force a poor villager to close a portion of his land, preventing the public from easily reaching the main road. Sakthi and his father invite them for talks at the village ''[[Panchayati raj in India|panchayat]]'' to resolve the standoff.

In the ''panchayat'', both sides repeatedly accuse the other. With no evidence, Mayan accuses Periya of orchestrating attacks on his brother's family and berates him. Disrespected and broken, Periya walks home and dies from a heart attack during sleep. Devastated and shocked about his father’s death and his disobedient behaviour, Sakthi takes over his father's duties as the village chieftain. The villagers express concern to Sakthi about having to daily circumnavigate the piece of land belonging to Mayan's side of the village, which causes a much longer travelling time. Sakthi reasons with the landowner Paramasivam to open it up for all villagers. Although understanding and willing, Paramasivam is Mayan's maternal uncle and is afraid of his nephew's backlash, especially because he has a daughter named Panchavarnam.

Sakthi assuages his fear by arranging the marriage between Panchavarnam and a Engineer from [[madurai]]. Everybody involved happily agrees, and Paramasivam opens up the land. On the day of the wedding, however, the groom runs away, fearing Mayan. Paramasivam and Panchavarnam are distraught, and worried if someone marries his daughter, they will live in constant fear. With her father's permission, Sakthi marries Panchavarnam, although he still has feelings for Bhanu. Mayan tries to counter sakthi by getting Muthuvel drunk and obtaining his signature on ridiculous loan papers. The scheme is foiled in the last minute by Sakthi. Bhanu returns to meet Sakthi and learns about Sakthi's marriage. Although saddened, she understands the situation and leaves. Sakthi starts his new life with Panchavarnam. While Sakthi and Panchavaranam are returning from dropping off Banu at the station, a drive by attempt is made on their life, which they narrowly escape. This brings them closer, and they start their marital intimacy.

Few weeks later, the [[HR&CE]] department plans the long pending temple celebrations and problem rises about the first respect. Muthuvel is ineligible as he is drunkard, and Mayan argues that he is next eldest heir of the builder of the temple. Sakthi gives up the first respect for peace, but Mayan rejects it. He publicly taunts sakthi that he will die soon and leaves. Weeks later, Sakthi is given the first respect, and the event starts. Sakthi's family learns that Panchavarnam is pregnant, and they are ecstatic.

Mayan plants a bomb during the temple chariot festival, causing deaths on both sides of the village. Enraged, both factions go after Mayan and his family. Sakthi protects the innocent family and helps them escape from the villagers. Appreciative of Sakthi's efforts to protect them, they disclose Mayan's hiding place. Sakthi locates Mayan and asks him to surrender to the police lest the villagers kill him but Mayan refuses. Mayan blames Sakthi for his problems and tries to kill him. In the ensuing struggle, Sakthi accidentally beheads Mayan. The villagers offer to take the blame for Mayan's death, but Sakthi refuses and surrenders to the police. He asks the villagers to maintain peace, promote education for all and leaves for jail, leaving the control in hands of his sister-in-law."

Sundarangathan is the brightest son while the other two are dimwitted. Hence, the king looks up to him for support to save the country. All the three brothers venture out of their country to do business.

Sundarangathan visits a research centre and listens to the words of [[pandit]]s. One of them reads out the five maxims of life:
# A father cares only for the riches earned by his son.
# Only a mother stands by the son through good and bad times.
# A sister values her brother only for the gift he brings her.
# A wife may even kill her husband.
# A friend in need is a friend indeed.

Sundarangathan is sceptical, and argues with the pandits before deciding to evaluate their validity. Instead of pursuing his business goal, Sundarangathan returns to Sundarapuri to verify the merits of the maxims, but his father again sends him away and prohibits him from returning without riches, convincing Sundarangathan that the first maxim is true.

Sundarangathan visits his mother who warmly welcomes him and is upset to know the reaction of his father. She offers him protection, advises him to stay back in the palace and promises that she will pacify the king. Sundarangathan refuses, but realises the second maxim is true.

Sundarangathan goes to his sister's country. His sister and her husband welcome him warmly. However, on realising that he did not bring any gifts or riches for her, she feels humiliated and disrespects him. Sundarangathan is forced to leave, but realises the third maxim is true.

Sundarangathan meets his wife Prema, who stayed back in her father's kingdom Sorgapuri as Sundarangathan was regularly travelling outside his kingdom. Sundarangathan is not aware that Prema is having an [[extramarital affair]] with [[Sait clan|Seth]] Namakharam, and is staying back in the place for this reason. Madhivanan, son of the minister and a friend of Sundarangathan, learns of the affair and visits Prema's palace twice to verify the same. However, she lies to Sundarangathan that Madhivanan is misbehaving by coming to her place regularly, misusing his friendship.

Sundarangathan reprimands Madhivanan, who reveals the affair and tells him to check for himself. Sundarangathan infiltrates Namakharam's services as a menial worker and gains his confidence. When Prema invites Namakharam to her palace, Sundarangathan accompanies him. Namakharam presents her a betel leaf, prepared by the worker. She notices that the folding is in Sundarangathan's style. Suspicious, she asks Namakharam who says the worker joined the day before. Prema sends her assistant to kill the worker, convincing Sundarangathan that the fourth maxim is true. He reveals his true identity to Prema and Namakharam.

Prema lies to her father that Sundarangathan attempted to kill her. Sundarangathan, accused of attempted murder, flees to another kingdom where he feigns insanity. However, he attracts the attention of princess Madhavi, who likes his behaviour and arranges for his treatment. When he is ""cured"", she makes him her and her sister Mallika's baggage carrier. Kattazhagan, their teacher's son, falls in love with Madhavi and demands that she should marry him. Sundarangathan comes to her rescue. The king learns that Sundarangathan is not insane, and that he is the prince of Sundarapuri who is banned there. He arrests Sundarangathan, but after Madhavi pleads, agrees to release him if his innocence is proven.

Sundarangathan is taken to Sorgapuri. When his father-in-law demands to know why he ran away, he is forced to reveal the details of Prema's affair. The king asks for proof. By then, Madhivanan brings Namakharam who confesses all. Prema's assistant also confirms it. Prema realises her mistake and accepts her crime, says that Sundarangathan should marry Madhavi and commits suicide. The king apologises to Sundarangathan and appoints him king. Sundarangathan's father reaches with his wife and sons and apologises for ill-treating Sundarangathan. Madhavi's father offers Madhavi to Sundarangathan. Sundarangathan explains his pursuit to find the validity of the maxims and getting them confirmed. At his request, Mallika marries Madhivanan while Sundarangathan marries Madhavi."

A disciplinarian, Ranganna lives with his three children and wife, Seetha. His elder son Gopi gets into fight with a troublesome student, Vasu. Although Vasu is punished, his innate goodness wins over his teacher and he is given special attention to become a better student.

Nagappa, the corrupt chairperson of the village [[Panchayati raj|panchayat]] frequently clashes with the honest Ranganna and the district authorities. After Ranganna refuses to campaign for him in the upcoming elections, Nagappa retaliates by burning down Ranganna's house. However, Ranganna's young students, led by Vasu, build a house for their teacher. Ranganna's efforts to convert the primary school into a [[Secondary school|high school]] are temporarily stalled when Nagappa steals the funds meant for the project and pins the blame on Ranganna. Nagappa is eventually caught and sentenced to seven years in prison.

Years later, Vasu tops his [[matriculation]] exams. Ranganna's sons marry — Gopi to Radha, Nagappa's daughter, and Ravikumar to Geetha, much against the parents' wishes. However, the parents accept these unions. Their daughter, Gowri, marries a simple businessman, Puttanna. Upon Ranganna's retirement, his sons are reluctant to take in their parents. With no savings of his own, Ranganna must rely on them to support his retired life.Gopi takes his father, while Ravikumar takes their mother. As a result, Ranganna is separated from his wife.

Over time, Ranganna’s eyesight deteriorates, and he is unable to even read his wife's letters because his son refuses to provide him with spectacles.  Both Ranganna and his wife are mistreated by their daughters-in-law, prompting them to leave their sons’ homes.

Meanwhile, Ranganna’s house, built by his students, is put up for auction. Vasu, now a  [[Superintendent of Police]], happens to pass by and notices the auction. In the climax, he buys the house and hands it over to Ranganna and Seetha, who have now been reunited. Ranganna is overwhelmed with emotion as he sees his once troublesome student has transformed into a role model. His journey as a teacher has come full circle, ending on a note of satisfaction."

Anjaneyulu|C.S.R]]<br>[[Vangara Venkata Subbaiah|Vangara]],"The film begins at [[Nelakondapalli]], where [[Bhadrachala Ramadasu|Kancherla Gopanna]] lost his father in childhood. Currently, when his mother is ailing, Gopanna walks to Dhammakka, a devout servant who looks after the idols of Rama on the hill at [[Bhadrachalam]]. Soon, he backs, and his mother happily leaves her breath with the blessing of [[Rama]], which shatters Gopanna. During that plight, he encounters [[Kabir|Kabirdas]], whose means of life is Rama's chanting. He enlightens Gopanna about grim reality and asks him to proceed further. Now the tale shifts to [[Golconda]] where [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah|Tanisha]] has strong faith in his true-blue ministers [[Madanna and Akkanna|Madanna & Akkanna]], the maternal uncles of Gopanna. They introduce him to the Empire, and he acquires his credence. Parallelly, there is a frequent call-off for the bridal connections of Madanna's daughter Kamala, as astrologers predict jail access is inevitable for the one that splices her. Despite this, Gopanna knits Kamala, and the couple is blessed with a son, Raghunatha. 

After a while, Gopanna revisits Bhadrachalam on the eve of the Lord's wedding ceremony, where Kabir Das arrives, but vicious Dharmakarta Pratap Giri Panthulu & Tehsildar Allaudin expel him. However, with his idolization, Kabir Das proves his divinity. Plus, Gopanna hinders the illegal acts therein, which envies the knaves. Following this, he conducts ''Annadanam,'' a sacred offering at his home. Tragically, Raghunatha dies while dropping into a well when Kabir retrieves him back with his holy strength. Now, Gopanna faithfully serves his mentor, who proclaims that his devotion is ideal, blesses him with ''Srirama Taraka Mantram,'' and nobilitates him as Ramadasu. Thus, he pledges to sanctify his totality to the Lord by constructing a temple at Bhadrachalam. Besides, Tanisha discerns Gopanna's widespread popularity and delegates him as Bhadrachalam's Tehsildar. Afterward, he awakes spiritually and publicly, collecting assets owed to Tanisha's taxes. He seeks approval from the emperor, which falls short of Dharmakarta & Allaudin's ploy. 

Years roll by, and Ramadasu triumphs in building a sublime temple when the heels tactically forge and accuse him of squandering govt funds. Ergo, Gopanna is apprehended and behind bars in a secluded prison. At which, he sculpts the idols of [[Sita]], Rama & [[Lakshmana]] and orchestrates prayers. Ramadasu calls the Lord with reverence, humility, eagerness, and notwithstanding anger, but in vain. Ultimately, he implores Sita, which stirs [[Lakshmi]], and she pleads [[Vishnu]] to secure him. Then, Vishnu states that Ramadasu was penalized since he caged a parrot for seven days in his past life. Currently, Vishnu takes the form of Rama & [[Shesha|Adiseshu]] as Lakshmana sets foot at Golkonda and vanishes, clearing the debt. Hereupon, Tanisha is under a dichotomy when Kabirdas irradiates him with the fact. Therefore, Tanisha learns the eminence of Ramadasu and the foul play of Dharmakarta & Allaudin and acquits him. At last, Tanisha permanently bestows Bhadrachalam on Ramadasu and his heritage, ''Mutyala Talambralu.'' Finally, the movie ends happily, with Ramadasu dedicating himself to the Lord's prayers."

Bhakta Tukaram,[[V. Madhusudhana Rao]],P. Adinarayana Rao,[[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]]<br />[[Anjali Devi]]<br />[[Sivaji Ganesan]],"The film is based on the story of [[Tukaram]], an advent devotee of [[Vithoba|Panduranga]] in the 17th century in [[Dehu]] village of present-day [[Maharashtra]]. Tukaram is kindhearted and ameliorates everyone, for which he absorbs his property. He leads a family with two wives, Avalai Jija Bai & Rukma Bai, and 2 infants. However, he is not interested in worldly matters. He is constantly immersed in the adoration of the Lord—Mumbaji Go Swamy, who presents himself as holy and exploits public faith for his own gain. Tukaram permanently exiles him, so resentful Mumbaji causes him much pain, lavelling him as an atheist, and ostracizing him. Hence, his family suffers from starvation even though no one comes forward to support him when Rukma Bai passes away. Devastated Tukaram quits questioning the existence of God when Panduranga appears and endorses his divinity as [[Abhang]] s to scripture. Now Tukaram awakes the devotion via singing and becomes eminent, which impresses emperor [[Shivaji]], who facilitates him with material gifts but refuses courteously. 

At this point, Mumbaji's envy is boundless, so he uses a brothel, Bahina Bai, to lure Tukaram when he shows the reality of life, how her beauty shrinks in old age and makes her a devotee. Later, Mumbaji claims that Tukaram stole his verses when Pandit Rameswara Bhattar, a religious authority, arrives and orders Tukaram to immerse his works in the river and never publicly discuss religion, which he does. The river [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]] retrieves it, affirming it as sacred when Rameswara Bhattar becomes his follower. Meanwhile, Mumbaji hides the Lord's statue, indicates Tukaram, and complains to Shivaji. So, he lands at Dehu to test Tukaram when, with his holy power, he restores the statue. Now, Mumbaji intrigues by notifying Shivaji's presence therein to the Mughals, but the Lord protects him at the behest of Tukaram. Knowing it, the enraged Mughal Empire amputates Mumbaji, which Tukaram retrieves, and he bows his head down. At last, the Lord invites Tukaram to [[Vaikuntha]] with the mortal body by sending his vehicle [[Garuda]]. Finally, the movie ends with Tukaram going to heaven, giving his ultimate preaching to follow righteousness, truth, peace, kindness & mercy."

Sri Valli (1961 film),[[T. R. Ramanna]],[[G. Ramanathan]],{{unbulleted list|[[Sivaji Ganesan]]|[[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]]}},"Goddess Valli had her heart and soul dedicated to Lord Subramanya and would always pray with fervent devotion and love, to be with Him. The Lord was moved by the highest form of love expressed by the mountain princess, and so He planned to appease Her in person by creating the perfect situation after the enactment of His Lila.

The mountain chief planned to develop a field for growing millet and assigned Valli to take charge of protecting the field from birds and animals who might devour the crops. Lord Murugan saw this as an opportunity to meet the Goddess, and therefore He assumed the form of a handsome tribal hunter and appeared before her as if he had lost his way on chasing a deer during hunting. Valli did not recognise the stranger and promptly asked him to leave the place. The Hunter was about to leave and at that moment the chief was returning to the place bringing honey and fruits for Valli. God, in order to avoid being caught, turned himself into a tree. After the chief and his followers left the place, God changed back into the hunter form and proposed his love to Valli.

The princess who had only the Mountain God in her heart was infuriated at the proposal and lashed out at the hunter. (This form of Lord Muruga called the 'Veduvan Kolam' can be seen at the Lord Palaniapaar temple at Belukurichi). The chief and his followers were again returning to the place, so the hunter changed himself into an old man, without being noticed by Valli. The chief, on seeing the old man, requested him to stay with Valli till they returned from the hunt.

The old man was hungry and asked Valli for food, she gave Him a mixture of millet flour and honey, but it made him thirsty and He asked for water. She provided water from a nearby stream and the Lord jokingly remarked that she had satisfied his thirst and she could quench his thirst for a companion. The Goddess has angered again and started to leave the place. The Lord requested assistance from His brother, Lord Ganesha to appear as a wild elephant at that time. On seeing the wild elephant, Valli was scared and ran back to the old man, pleading with Him to save Her from the elephant. Lord Muruga proposed to save Her only if She agreed to marry Him. In the heat of the moment, she agrees and the Lord reveals His true form. It was then Valli realised that it was her beloved Lord, who was with her all the time. After the millet harvest was over, the chief with his daughter and entourage returned to their native land. The Lord again returned for His devotee and The Divine Couple enjoyed their time away from Valli's family. Nambi Raja on being alerted about Valli's absence flew into a rage and went in search of Her. When they finally found The Lord along with Valli, the chief and followers shot arrows at Him, but they all failed to even touch the Lord and instead, the chief and his sons fell lifeless. Goddess Valli was disheartened to see the lifeless bodies of her kith and kin and requested the Lord to bring them back to life. Lord Murugan instructed Her to revive them Herself and by Her mere touch, everyone was brought back to life. The chief Nambi Raja and his tribesmen realised that it was their God of Mountains, in the form of the old man and prayed to Him. Lord Muruga took his true form and blessed the tribesmen, and the chief conducted the marriage of his daughter and the Lord."

Aboard an aeroplane, he meets Latha, an air hostess. Latha lives with her father, mother, two brothers, and a sister. Her elder brother resides at home with his wife, but Latha is the highest earning member of the family. Latha's mother objects to her being an air hostess; she begs her to change profession so that she can be home at more decent hours.

While Anand is celebrating his birthday in a pub near his home, Latha arrives at the same pub for a job interview with the manager. However, the lustful manager, in the guise of interviewing her, tries to rape her. Anand hears Latha screaming, subdues the manager, rescues Latha, then drives her home. The next day, Latha goes to Anand's house to return the coat he had lent her the night before. She then asks him for a job, to which he agrees, hiring her as his secretary.

The next day Anand shows her around his house, and she meets his mother, elder brother Vijay, and sister-in-law. Latha soon notices that Anand is an alcoholic, and therefore wishes to resign, but a servant begs her not to because Anand's behaviour has changed for the better since meeting her.

Anand's fiancée comes to his home and starts ranting that she no longer wishes to marry him because he is an alcoholic. Meanwhile, his sister-in-law, who concludes that Latha has come to steal Anand's affections, disturbs his mother with these comments. Latha, however, assures the mother, after everyone has left the table, that she will, in fact, try and stop Anand from drinking. Later on, she catches him drinking with his servant Panchavarnam. His servant runs away upon seeing her, but Anand continues to drink. Latha throws the glass after arguing with him, infuriating Anand into throwing a glass bottle onto her forehead.

When Anand realises what he has done, he destroys all his bottles, promising Latha that he will never drink again. He confides in her the anguish of his soul, how when he was young both his father and his Ayya died. After this transformative incident, he announces that he is going to build a new palace for himself and the girl that he truly loves. He will call the palace ""Vasantha Maligai"" (palace of spring).

Anand brings Latha to this new house; everyone in his family goads Latha to find out who this mysterious woman is. Latha, too, is curious to meet the girl of Anand's heart. He then shows her her own reflection in a separate room revealing that she is the girl of his affections. However, Vijay witnesses this and runs to tell his mother. He conjures up a story about Latha having stolen his wife's jewellery. Hearing this, Anand becomes suspicious of Latha. He asks Latha about it, but she runs away, dejected that he could suspect her of such wrongdoing. Fortunately, Anand learns about Vijay's malicious plan.

Anand confesses his ignorance and apologises. But Latha does not forgive him. Anand loses his composure and becomes seriously ill. Meanwhile, Latha receives a marriage proposal. Anand's mother goes to apologise to Latha while Latha hands her an invitation to her wedding. Anand's mother shows this to her son, who then decides to attend the wedding. Latha is shocked to see him. She meets him privately to reconcile their differences, but her sister-in-law and the groom's mother spot them and announce it to the guests who depart, botching Latha's marriage. All of a sudden, Anand's mother enters the room and declares that Latha should marry Anand. When Latha arrives at the palace, she is shocked to see Anand's condition. She does not know that, out of desperation and lovesickness, he drank poison. As soon as Latha enters the room he collapses. Anand is hospitalised and after recovering, he re-unites with Latha."

Jeeva tries to bring Vaani in marriage with Karan. But Vaani appears in traditional widow's garb before Jeeva, his wife, and Karan's younger paternal uncle and aunt as they discuss the marriage. She fears that her ties with Jeeva and his wife will be severed if she remarries. The couple accept her decision with grief.

Vaani and Karan secretly record a conversation between Vasu and Mohana, revealing a ship scam. Vasu's men chase them, but they escape. Vinoth, their companion, takes only the camera as a distraction for Vasu's men and asks Vaani and Karan to bring the tape to Jeeva. '''Vinoth''' arrives at Jeeva’s office with bullet wounds, explaining that he allowed himself to be captured while Vaani and Karan fled into the forest. He urges Jeeva to save them. Jeeva approaches the inspector, who directs him to Mohana.  Jeeva confronts her, offering to destroy the evidence in exchange for Vaani and Karan’s safety. Mohana mocks him and tells him to bring a petition. After a tense exchange, she orders her men to assault him.

Meanwhile, Vaani and Karan are captured by more henchmen, who torture them for the tape's location. While recovering in the hospital, Jeeva learns that his office was set on fire, and his wife is killed. He seeks out the inspector and kills him in retaliation. In the forest, Vaani manages to escape and attempts to rescue Karan from his torturers. She falls into the water, but Karan saves her, urging her to get the tape to the court. Jeeva calls ''Dina Madal'' from a phone booth and informs the sub-editor that, due to his ongoing confrontation with Mohana, he must remain undercover. This message is later published in the paper.

Mohana's partymen invite her for a wedding, and despite fearing Jeeva’s retaliation, she agrees to attend with heavy security. Meanwhile, Vasu, unaware that Vaani's and Karan's have escaped, orders one of his men to kill them for refusing to reveal the location of the tape.

Mohana arrives at the wedding under tight security. As she ascends the dais, the policemen assigned to protect her spot a suspicious man disguised as a godman. When they approach him, he flees but assaults a server, taking his place. After the wedding feast, Jeeva confronts Mohana and shoots her. Moments later, he is shot by the chief security officer in the ensuing chaos. Despite his injury, Jeeva sees Mohana attempting to escape through a glass exit. He throws an axe-like tool at the door, shattering the glass, which falls on Mohana, killing her. Jeeva is later brought to court, where the judge asks if he is responsible for the deaths of the inspector and Mohana. Jeeva asks the judge if responds by asking if figures like [[Krishna]], [[Vanchinathan]] and [[Bhagat Singh]] can be considered murderers.

Meanwhile, Karan finds Vasu and strangles him. The film ends with Karan being arrested and taken to jail."

He is held in high esteem by the villagers for his prowess. One day, his uncle Chockalingam, Chockalingam's wife Bama and their foreign-educated daughter Kalpana come to Sholavandan to participate in the [[Mariamman]] festival. Kalpana is fascinated by Mookaiyan's prowess; her mother disapproves of Kalpana's emotional reaction while her father is happy. Bama settles a young man of Madurai to marry Kalpana. Moved by the pleas of Chockalingam, Mookaiyan goes to the bridegroom's house and brings back Kalpana, saying that he has the right by birth to marry her.

Married life starts well for Mookaiyan and Kalpana, but before long differences arise because of their different backgrounds. At Kalpana's birthday party, Mookaiyan objects to drinking and dancing by her [[hippie]] friends. He beats Kalpana, and she leaves him to join her mother. A lawyer's notice for divorce is received. Mookaiyan futilely tries to make Bama understand the situation. The mother and daughter are adamant and Mookaiyan returns home determined to teach them a lesson.

Kalpana, having been impregnated by Mookaiyan some time earlier, gives birth to a child. In her anxiety to save Kalpana from further involvements, Bama leaves the child in an orphanage. Kalpana is shocked by this act of her mother. By the time she goes to recover the child, Mookaiyan has already taken it away. Kalpana beseeches her father to get the child from Mookaiyan. Unexpectedly, Mookaiyan comes there to deliver an invitation card for his marriage with his cousin Rakkamma. Kalpana and her parents are now repentant.

Kalpana goes alone to Mookaiyan's house and asks her husband to leap over their child and then tie the ''[[Mangala sutra|thali]]'' to another girl. To her surprise, Kalpana discovers that the marriage being celebrated is that of a different man named Mookaiyan, while her husband did no injustice to her; she falls at her husband's feet and the family reunites."

Malathi later gives birth to a male child, fathered by Arun before his death. Malathi's father who fears for his family's reputation as the child was born out of wedlock, deceives Malathi that the child was stillborn and dumps the baby in a garbage bin. The child is discovered in the bin by a car driver Seenu and raised by him and his wife who are childless and they name the child Thangaraja. Seenu and his wife later have a daughter of their own.

Thangaraja grows up with an angry temperament and gets infuriated when berated by other children who call him 'kuppai thotti' (garbage bin) referring to where he was found as a baby. Once he badly beats up the son of his father's boss Dharmalingam after such an insult and fearing punishment, runs away from home, never to be found by his parents.

Time passes and Thangaraja turns up in his adulthood as Pattakkathi Bhairavan, a notorious criminal sought by the police for several murders which he commits using his customary pattakkathi (gauntlet-sword). He takes orders for his crimes from a mysterious man called the 'boss'. During one such criminal assignment, he is tasked by his boss to kill a child but can't go through with it and when he tries to return the child back to its mother, he gets arrested. When in jail, he encounters his adopted father Seenu and learns how Seenu's boss Dharmalingam had ruined his adopted family. After escaping from prison, he finds out that Dharmalingam is the same man known as the 'boss' whom he works for and murders him. While fleeing after the murder he has a chance encounter with Malathi, who is stunned by his resemblance to Arun.

As the Police launch a manhunt for him, Bhairavan camouflages himself as Karnan, a rich businessman to deceive the Police and also is reunited with his step-sister Deepa. Deepa's close friend Roopa is Bhairavan's romantic interest, but in a twist, Deepa herself is in love with police officer Arjunan, who is the son of Malathi and her police officer husband whom she had married after Arun's demise. Arjunan is actually on a mission to find and eliminate the elusive Pattakkathi Bhairavan. Bhairavan approaches and interacts with Arjunan quite convincingly masquerading as businessman Karnan, but Malathi recognises Bhairavan/Karnan as none other than her own first son whom she had borne out of wedlock, but struggles to tell him the truth, since he professes a profound hatred for his unknown mother, who he believes had dumped him in a garbage bin as a baby. Meanwhile, tipped off by a jail superindentent familiar with Bhairavan, Arjunan and his father begin to suspect Karnan's identity. How the events unfold form the rest of the story."

Ramalingam starts his task of telling people, but no one believes him in the beginning. However, his ""predictions"" of train accident, among others, start to happen in real time. Slowly when what he says starts occurring people term him a powerful monk and start coming to him. God takes several other famous actor forms and keeps hinting the world through Ramalingam. One day, God tells Ramalingam that his son is going to die. The tables turn and Ramalingam starts cursing God though he still keeps his faith. In the end, he is arrested as a terrorist for pointing out a train accident before it happened, something one cannot know without inside knowledge. God appears in court which the judge mocks. God disappears in front of all to show he is God and Ramalingam is not insane. God gives Ramalingam his son back saying this is why God no longer interferes in human affairs."

Rangan, an uneducated and naïve orphan, is raised as a family member and he in return is very dedicated to this family, especially his adopters&nbsp;– Chandrasekar and Parvathi. Parvathi promises her dying poor friend that her friend's daughter Lakshmi would be married to Parvathi's son. But since her son loves another woman, Rangan agrees to marry Lakshmi to keep up Parvathi's word. On the day of his younger daughter's betrothal, Chandrasekar loses heavily in the stock market. The engagement is cancelled by the groom's father seeing the sudden change of fortunes. The fate of the house changes dramatically as the creditors storm the house, demanding repayment of their money. The sons' behaviour also changes drastically.

Though Raghu and Lakshmi take good care of Chandrasekar and Parvathi, the other family members insult them now and falsely accuse Lakshmi of stealing valuables. Lakshmi pleads with Rangan to leave the household, but he refuses. Understanding the situation, Chandrasekar and Parvathi forcibly send Rangan and Lakshmi away to enable them to live in peace, away from the turmoil. The naïve Rangan leaves and obtains work in a factory. He saves money to gift Chandrasekar his favourite cigars which he could not live without. When Rangan presents the cigars, he is reprimanded for being a spendthrift by Chandrasekar's family. Rangan leaves with a broken heart.

Rangan misses Chandrasekar's family and tries to come to their help on every occasion. Chandrasekar is pulled into more litigation; unable to take the stress, he dies. Parvathi is neglected by her children; when she falls ill, Rangan gets her treated. The creditors announce a public auction of Chandrasekar's house to recover their dues, and the sons do nothing to save their house. Rangan saves the factory owner's son (whose engagement to Chandrasekar's daughter had been cancelled) from an accident. The owner offers Rangan money, but he makes him realise that money is not everything; with Lakshmi, he convinces him to have his son marry Chandrasekar's younger daughter. The owner buys Chandrasekar's house in the auction and gifts it to Rangan for saving his son, who in turn gives them to Chandrasekar's family.

One day Raman gets a [[seizure]], falls into the village tank and almost drowns until a woman named Devaki, who was informed by a witness, saves him. Devaki is the younger sister of Minor Rajarathnam, a [[zamindar]] and the richest man in the village, and has just returned from [[Chennai|Madras]]. Raman becomes infatuated with Devaki, who only feels affection for him because of his childish nature, which others misinterpret as love.

At night, Raman breaks into Devaki's bedroom and declares his love for her; to prove it, he jumps out of the window and survives the fall, only breaking a leg. After recovering, he visits Rajarathnam and requests him for permission to marry Devaki. Rajarathnam humiliates and beats Raman up, citing the fact that there are millionaire suitors for Devaki whereas Raman is poor. In response, Raman vows to become rich and marry Devaki. He then leaves to Madras looking for his fortune.

In Madras, Raman struggles to earn money while doing menial jobs. He meets his best friend Mookurinji, now a film actor known as Gopi. With his help, Raman joins the film industry. At a shooting spot a writer is looking for someone to recite a dialogue. When no one volunteers, Raman jumps in and tries to impress the writer. His recitation does not impress the writer, but his enthusiasm and spirit wins the director's favour. He soon becomes a successful [[movie star]] known as Vijayakumar.

Raman returns to Poongudi, dreaming to marry Devaki, but is shattered upon learning that she was forced to marry Muthu, a rich man, under compulsion from her brother. Heartbroken, he returns to Madras. A few days later, he finds Devaki and she tells him about the cowardly Muthu and that she left him. The reason being that after ill-treating her, he took her to a party. There his friend Balu tried to rape her and threatened to shoot anyone trying to stop him. Muthu fled for his life, forcing Devaki to knock Balu out with a vase. After hearing this, Raman offers to take care of her which she refuses.

Balu again tries to rape Devaki, who kills him this time. Devaki runs to Raman and gives him her baby daughter Sumathi to take care of her while she surrenders to the police. Using his influence, Raman helps Devaki receive a reduced sentence of five years. Meanwhile Raman brings up and educates Sumathi. Having squandered his wealth, Muthu becomes the school bus driver of Sumathi and Sumathi realises he is missing his wife. She meets his wife (her mother) at jail coincidentally. Raman is with Sumathi during this meeting but Devaki stops him from speaking. Completing her jail sentence, Devaki becomes a teacher in a small school letting Raman know of her whereabouts.

Time moves on as Sumathi goes to college, being brought up as a well mannered girl by Raman. She then falls in love with Gopi. Raman agrees to their marriage. He informs Devaki and requests her presence. When he brings Devaki home, Sumathi is absent as she has gone to a party. Raman rushes to the party and finds an attempt to rape Sumathi taking place. He fights the rapist but an attack by the rapist triggers a seizure, due to which Raman loses control and accidentally kills him. Sumathi saves Raman and brings him home by taxi.

Anandan and Chinnaiah Pillai travel to Chennai to meet Duraisami and the estranged father and son meet for the first time without realizing their actual relationship. Duraisami still lives with his sister Mangalam and her son Kumar. Kumar, being a money-minded person attempts to tarnish the image of Anandan during his stay in Chennai only to get disappointed as Duraisami develops impeccable faith and affection for Anandan.

As harvest season approaches, Duraisami sends Karpagam and Kumar to Vadipatti, assuring to reach the village after a few days. Kumar, after reaching the village joins hands with Minor Arunagiri and plot against Anandan. Kumar conspires to marry Sivakami and convinces Minor Arunagiri to forego his fascination for the girl to which the greedy Minor Arunagiri agrees.

Eventually, Duraisami visits the village and evinces keen interest in the plot of land that Karpagam had bought for Anandan. Anandan politely refuses to sell the land citing sentimental reasons which Duraisami accepts and gives up the idea. However, Karpagam who hadn't seen Duraisami yet, develops a negative impression about Duraisami and vehemently refuses to accept Anandan's explanations.

Anandan learns of Kaveri's love affair with Shanmugam and with the help of Chinnaiah Pillai, arranges for their engagement. Kumar disrupts the groom family's procession and also steals the paddy cultivated from Anandan's land. A ferocious Anandan wishes to hack both Kumar and Minor Arunagiri but gets stopped by his beloved mother. Anandan vows not to hurt anyone anymore. Kumar, however continues his grudge against Anandan and injures him surrounded by Minor Arunagiri and his goons. Duraisami and Chinnaiah Pillai rush to the scene, rescue Anandan and escort him to his house where Karpagam is not present. Duraisami gives some hefty cash to Anandan for his sister's engagement and leaves. Karpagam after returning home is angry with Anandan for accepting cash from a stranger and Anandan decides to return the cash to Duraisami.

In the meanwhile, Duraisami orders Kumar and Mangalam to leave his house. Mangalam gets emotional and screams at her brother for being ungrateful to her for all the help she and her husband did after Duraisami had murdered his own wife. Kumar takes advantage of this secret, blackmails Duraisami and manages to create a rift between him and Anandan.

With Minor Arunagiri's help, Kumar visits Chinnaiah Pillai's house and proposes to marry Sivakami. Anandan disagrees with Sivakami's plan to elope and get married somewhere outside the village. Karpagam assures Sivakami that she would talk to Annapurani and convince her to allow Sivakami to marry Anandan. But, Annapurani stops Karpagam in the entrance as already Duraisamy and Mangalam are seated inside to finalise Kumar-Sivakami marriage. Mangalam watches Karpagam pleading with Annapurani and realizes that Duraisami's wife is still alive. Sivakami argues with Duraisami and explains to him her unwillingness to marry Kumar which the latter appreciates.

Duraisami decides not to succumb to Kumar's pressure anymore. Even though Mangalam explains to Kumar that Duraisami hasn't killed his wife as he believes, Kumar hatches a plan to kill his uncle with the help of Minor Arunagiri.

Anandan suspects that Duraisami is under siege decides to go to his house and seek clarifications. Duraisami shows Anandan a picture of Karpagam whom he still considers to be dead. Anandan explains that Karpagam is alive and she is his mother. Duraisami, briefly glad to know about Karpagam's well-being, raises doubts about Kaveri, because at the time of fleeing, Karpagam had conceived her first child, Anandan. An emotional Anandan reaches home, informs about Duraisami and asks her about Kaveri. With Duraisami overhearing from outside, Karpagam reveals that Kaveri is the daughter of her erstwhile neighbor friend who died in a road accident. Once doubts are clarified, Duraisami enters the house and the family reunites.

Minor Arunagiri kidnaps Sivakami and keeps her in captivity for Kumar. Anandan reaches the spot, rescues her after a fight. Duraisami resumes living with his wife, son and daughter."

Raghavan is a man of integrity and humaneness who views the 500 inmates as 500 books that need to be perused. He stays with his wife Alamu in the bungalow adjoining the penitentiary, and the childless couple treats the prisoners with compassion and love, for they look upon the inmates as the children they never had. Chamundi who is serving a life sentence for killing one of the 2 villains who had fatally molested his teenage daughter Sivakami.

In the nearby Allikkulam village lives Manickam- an honest, hardworking youth who is the leaseholder of Raghavan's lands. Manickam and Kokila love each other. The scoundrel Marimuthu, an unwelcome suitor of Kokila, sees his dreams of marrying Kokila coming to nought, and schemes with his accomplices to harm Manickam. They spy Manickam and Kokila singing and romancing, and this increases their ire. Marimuthu accosts Manickam near the Aiyanaar statue. When Marimuthu speaks deprecatingly of Manickam's lineage, Manickam sees red. He plucks the sword from the hands of the Aiyanaar statue and injures Marimuthu. Manickam is arrested and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. Superintendent Raghavan consoles him and treats him with kindness. With the unusual backdrop of a prison, original story author JK endows each character with an interesting history and subtle idiosyncrasies.

The story then captures the interesting events in the prison. Of particular interest are the sequences that involve Chamundi. Chamundi sees the other man who was responsible for his daughter's death as an inmate in the prison and manages to hack him to death one night. For this crime, Chamundi is sentenced to death, and the death sentence is carried out. In the meantime, Manickam gets the news that his mother is seriously unwell. He grieves for her and longs to pay her a visit. On his own accord Superintendent Raghavan takes the unprecedented step of permitting Manickam to go to Allikulam to see his mother, after eliciting a promise from him that he would return to the prison by daybreak. The next day is Raghavan's last day in service, and Raman Nair arrives to take charge as the new superintendent. Manickam has not yet returned, and Raman Nair refuses to take charge until the headcount tallies with the roster. Raghavan is confident that Manickam will return, and his confidence is not misplaced. Manickam arrives just in the nick of time. Raghavan retires; his honour and reputation untarnished."

Kandaswamy, working with Doctor Gopu, notices the happenings in the family and feels bad. Gopu, in order to settle a loan, borrows money from Moorthy after signing a mortgage letter. Kandaswamy takes some money from that to clear all family dues and Gopu dismisses him for that. Moorthy comes home when Nalina is alone and tries to molest her, but Kandaswamy saves her. Gopu arrives there realises his mistake and unites with Nalini and takes Kandaswamy back in job. After the exams, Sundar leaves to Chennai to get his father's concurrence to marry Sumathi. After a few weeks, he writes to Sumathi's that he will be coming in a week to finalise the marriage.

Meanwhile, Sundar gets a letter from the Government providing him a two years scholarship for higher studies in America as a reward for securing the highest marks in the state. Since it's a rare opportunity, his father consents. Sundar meets Sumathi and her father and takes their consent too and travels to America. Meanwhile, Gopu is harassed by the lenders. Unable to pay back, Gopu leaves home after writing a note to Nalina. Moorthy takes possessions of Gopu's house in lieu of his dues.

Sumathi agrees to the marriage to support her family and settle Gopu's loans, though both her father and Nalina do not accept her plan. On the wedding day, Sumathi's father passes away, unable to see his daughter marrying an old man. That night, Dayaparar realises that his son Sundar and Sumathi were lovers earlier. Brokenhearted, he leaves home writing a letter to Sumathi in which he leaves all his wealth to her and gives her the freedom to choose a life of her own (to remarry). Dayaparar wanders around visiting temples and holy places and in one of the temples he sees Sundar begging&nbsp;– being blind he did not want to be burden to his father and hence was living alone. Father and Son rejoin. Gopu returns to Sumathi's house as a reformed man and starts his medical practice again. He dreams of his Sister remarrying, but Sumathi still thinks of Dayaparar as her husband.

Sundar requests his father to take him to Sumathi's house in Tiruchy. Dayaparar takes him to Tiruchy and sends him to her house alone and stays back to avoid confusion. Sundar meets and proposes to Sumathi and she informs that she is already married and agrees to be just his friend. They meet often and Sundar suggests remarrying as her husband has moved away.

On a rainy night, Sundar meets Sumathi at her home, holds her hand and tries to get her consent to marry him, now that her husband has died.

Sumathi gets angry and slaps him for trying to take advantage of her situation and makes it clear that in her life there is place only for Dayaparar. Sundar is shocked at her rejection. Gopu learns about Sundar's situation and operates on Sundar's eyes and he gets back in eyesight. Gopu takes Sundar to his house to unite him with Sumathi. Reaching there, Sundar is shocked to see the portrait of his father with a garland and realises that Sumathi has actually married his father and is now his stepmother. He feels guilty and rushes to apologise to his father, but it was too late as Dayaparar has died. Sumathi and her family are shocked to learn that Sundar's father was Dayaparar. Dayaparar had left a letter to Sumathi in which he apologises for marrying her and asks Sumathi to live on her own terms. Sumathi reconciles herself to live as a mother to Sundar than remarrying and he also appreciates that and calls her as his mother.

Viswanathan]],"[[Sivaji Ganesan]]<br />[[Vijaya Nirmala]]<br />[[Sharada (actress)|Saratha]]<br />[[Srikanth (actor, born 1940)|Srikanth]]","Anthony an orphan, warm-hearted, yet physically effervescent is a wooden casket maker by profession. He is a regular church bell ringer raised by the guidance of the kind church Father. He marries. The day his lady goes into labour, he agrees to fabricate a wooden coffin for a supposedly dying person for his plausible money needs. Whilst fabricating he is notified that, that person who seemed dying miraculously survived, leaving his half-done coffin to no use, much to his irritation. However, the Father arrives and informs Anthony that a daughter was born, but also clarifies his half-done coffin was not merely a waste since his wife did not survive the labour. Shadowed with sadness, he raises his daughter, (Named Marie, after Mother Mary) baptised by the father of the church he goes to. Life moves on.

Years later, his teen-aged daughter, (Marie) sent to the city for pursuing her education, comes home on holiday. The eldest Father blesses both Marie and Anthony and expresses his desire for Marie to reach the pinnacle of her career (that she was doing well) and must be capable of building trust organisations, education systems and hospitals for the well-being of the needy. Anthony desires that his daughter fulfill father's wishes that he even refuses to get her married to someone in near future. Later, Lawrence, a police officer, and Anthony's long-lost childhood friend are introduced to Anthony by the elder Father. A mutual and solid friendship bonds between the two.

Curious about his friends' daughters' intelligence traits, Lawrence expresses his interest to meet Marie, which Anthony accedes to. Lawrence and Anthony arrive at Anthony's home and both get shocked seeing Anthony's daughter in a prurient position with an unknown male, infuriating Anthony as he always considered her his divine gift from God, and lunges to kill her and her lover. Lawrence confronts Anthony's rage and stops him and gets his daughter to exchange rings as an informal marriage to her male lover in the very place they were caught and makes Anthony swear not to make any worse of the situation in the name of the Lord. Anthony, controlled by Lawrence's deed, informs this quagmire to the Father at the church the next day. The Father, seeking to correct things, makes Anthony arrange formally the marriage between the two. Anthony seeks the male friend who his daughter was caught with.

Tracing the boy as a different religion, Anthony meets a Hindu doctor who the boy claimed to be his father, but is devastated to found out he was a profuse liar. However, finding him, Anthony persuades him gently and pleads him to marry his daughter. But knowing his real playboy attitude, and his atrocity in refusing to marry Marie anguishes Anthony, who forcibly brings the boy to the church in order to do his wedding with his daughter. But things go horribly when he brought the boy to the church. He had accidentally killed the boy in the scuffle even though he didn't wish to. Lawrence arrives and arrests Anthony in front of the Father, who had no chances of helping his beloved son. Lawrence had to value his police job overseeing his friend's agony and loyalty to the eldest Father and the church and yet having him arrested. Anthony is sentenced.

A few days later, Anthony, behind bars, learns that his daughter also disappeared, much to his pain. At the church, the aged Father tells Lawrence his last wish to see Anthony and requests his temporary bail, since he had become too old to visit prisons. Abiding by the Father's request, Lawrence agrees to take care of Anthony after his sentence, but until which he will sincerely adhere to his police duty. Attributing his short temper and roguish nature whenever he gets anguished was that which lead him to being guilty despite being innocent by heart, the father gives Anthony a holy candlestick and makes Anthony promise him such that he should become a person of grown wisdom and requests him to act with purity. Having lost all the loved ones, except Lawrence, who had to serve justice, makes Anthony grieve.  Until Anthony serves his sentence, Lawrence would only treat him as a vigilante and despise him. Remembering the Father's desire to build a good community of hospitals and educational institutions for the needy, and knowing it was not possible without his daughter, he decides to do so himself, while both condole the eldest father's loss.

After 2 decades, Anthony returns a mature and disciplined as Mr. Arun, a millionaire, changed not to escape Lawrence or the law for the murder he had accidentally committed, but for the solemn promise he made to the late Father that raised him for serving the needs of poor that he himself wanted Marie to do as Anthony. Once he finishes serving the good deeds as per his father's wish, he would eventually turn himself to the law for his crime. He had fulfilled almost all promises to his church Father of serving mankind. He comes back to the church where he rang the bell during his initial days and meets other children in the orphanage he founded and is on the verge of turning himself in to the law for his crime. He gets shocked to see his own daughter Marie as a teacher in that same church, who he had assumed expired. Before he could confess to Marie that he was none other than her own father, he comes to notice Lawrence was still around. As a guardian of Marie and her family, Lawrence was always around them fulfilling his promise of supporting his friend Anthony's family should he be absent. Anthony's escape led the police department to suspect Lawrence since they were once best friends, and hence his promotion was denied. However, he stuck around Marie hoping to find Anthony and be true to his duty.

Eventually learning Marie has a daughter herself who was of marriageable age, he yearned to see them. Arun (Anthony), during his rise to fame was deprived of a family by the loss of his loved ones, especially the church Father and his daughter Marie. Having known not all his loved ones are dead, he considers his granddaughter's well-being his last duty. Meanwhile, unaware that Mr. Arun was none but her own dad, Anthony, she kept away from him. Marie had lived with the same good Hindu doctor, the one whom she had a relationship with had claimed to be his father. They eventually meet, where Arun exposes his real identity to Marie as she relates that her father was back in an emotional confluence. Lawrence, meanwhile, learns of Arun as a new wealthy icon in town and greets Arun, who out of compulsion meet each other. Lawrence, familiar with Anthony's face and body language is suspicious about Arun's activity being similar to Anthony's, but he discreetly hesitates as Arun (Anthony) was a social figure and could not be approached easily, let alone be apprehended.

Arun arrives to know that Marie's daughter (his own granddaughter) falls in love similar to what Marie did when she was in her age. Having known it was Lawrence's son she was in love with, he does not object, in the name of philanthropy."

Vijayakumari]],"Thyagarajan ""Thyagu"" is a lonely rich bachelor, subjected to a deep-seated trauma from having witnessed the death of a childhood playmate, caused by his possessiveness. This is recurring theme in Thyagarajan's life, leading to disastrous results.

The movie begins with an imposing bell being rung, a voice narrates the story of a poor man, Arumugam Pillai, who was about to commit suicide on the death rock, but was stopped by the sound of the divine bell from the temple. He decides to take another chance with his life and soon he becomes a rich man and his son is none other than Thyagu, our hero!

Thyagarajan meets and becomes close friends with a virtuous man Sekhar and there is a well grown sense of mutual admiration and fondness amongst the friends. Sekhar and Meena are in love and Sekar promises he will ask her hand in marriage. Unbeknownst to both of them, Thyagu comes across Meena, whose father Muthaiah Pillai works in Thyagu's estate and impressed by her vivacity, Thyagu falls head over heels for her. This has all the makings of a typical love triangle.

Meena has a sister, Pushpalatha, who falls in love with the villain Aatkondan Pillai's son who demands a large amount in dowry. Muthaiah Pillai is unable to rustle up the requisite cash and is now in the doldrums concerned about the fate of his elder daughter's marriage. Thyagu comes helping with the cash and they are wedded. Shortly thereafter, Thyagu proposes to marry Meena and sends Sekhar as his messenger.

Except Sekhar and Meena, to their obvious shock and despair, it looks to the rest of the relatives that Thyagu and Meena are a pair made for each other. Sekhar, realising the extent of love and the depth of feelings of Thyagu asks Meena to forgo their feelings and that she should go ahead and marry Thyagu. The family members of both the families get together and agree to the arrangement. By this time, Thyagu, injured in a serious accident loses the use of both his legs and ends up being a cripple for life. The loyal partner Meena pitches into the effort to care for Thyagu and spends all her time caring for him.

Sekhar can't forget Meena and tries to be close with her, while she honours her commitment to Thyagu and keeps Sekhar at a distance. Thinking Sekhar as a single, Prema, daughter of the Aatkondan Pillai, expresses her feelings for Sekhar and he fails to respond in kind.

All these pent up emotions of love, friendship, loyalty, jealousy and physical debilitation boils over at one point and things take a turn for the worse for all three. Goaded by the feelings of inadequacy, Thyagu builds in his mind a picture, that his dear friend Sekhar is out to get his love, and decides to take matters into his hands and get rid of Sekhar. The lingering doubts about his friend and lover is now fuelled by his restive passions which are burning brightly.

Thyagu plans that the appropriate location for revenge is the Death rock known for its enchanting scenery and dangerous cliffs, where once his father attempted suicide. He was to drive Sekhar to the edge and push him to death from the face of the cliff. Thyagu leads Sekhar to the cliff and reveals his anger and frustration about their perceived relationship, questioning the sincerity of his friend and his lover. A visibly angered Sekhar repulses by revealing the magnitude of his sacrifice he made for his close friend and to prove his innocence, Sekhar swears to take his own life from the same Death rock. Truth dawns on Thyagu, now deeply humiliated, jumps from the cliff to the tumultuous sea below.

While Sekhar and Meena are mourning for their loss, Thyagu gets rescued by a fisherman and the shock of falling from the cliff has given back Thyagu the partial use of his legs. Meena now deems her as a widow and convinces Sekhar to marry the girl who loves him. On the wedding day, Thyagu, now dressed as a nobody shows up for the wedding and happens to overhear a conversation of Meena declaring that there is no life and happiness left due to Thyagu's death. This convinces Thyagu to reveal his identity and console Saroja, while Aatkondan Pillai with an eye on Thyagu's money thinks otherwise. Thyagu is hit on the head and falls unconscious, the marriage completes and Meena decides to take her life from the same cliff Thyagu plunged to death and seen running towards the cliff. Conscious now, Thyagu goes after Meena to stop her from committing suicide, calling out loud to stop and limping all the way behind her.

Meena sees Thyagu is alive and changes her mind and the lovers unite. In the background, the song ""Ponnai Virumbum Boomiyile"" (meaning: In a world of wealth lovers, the dear one who loved me) is being played, a happy Thyagu and Meena waves us a farewell, the movie ends."

Her brother Naganathan replaces it with a dead child, and informs king Varaguna Pandiyan that the newborn is dead. To Naganathan's surprise, the queen gives birth to another boy soon after. Minister Gunaseelar arrives by then, and the king is informed of the birth of two children, one dead and one alive. Everyone is happy that at least one is alive. Naganathan decides to kill the first infant and hands it over to his servant Somappa. However, Somappa and his wife raise the prince in a forest.

The crown prince is Vikraman, and his identical twin in the forest is Parthiban. On his deathbed, the king appoints Naganathan as the guardian of crown prince Vikraman, and gives the order that Naganathan would be solely responsible for Vikraman's safety. To achieve his objective of ruling the country, Naganathan brings up Vikraman with all vices and does not allow him to bond with his mother. On the other hand, Parthiban grows up to become a valiant warrior under the guidance of Somappa and fights for the public.

After the king's death, Vikraman ascends the throne and hands over administrative controls to Naganathan, who indulges in all kind of looting by levying more taxes. Parthiban comes out of the forest and saves the minister's daughter Amuthavalli, when her chariot goes out of control. They fall in love, and he starts visiting her palace late in the night. Amutha encounters Vikraman, who looks similar to Parthiban, but does not disclose this to anyone. Vikraman likes her and tells Naganathan to fix his marriage with her. Amutha does not accept when Vikraman's mother comes with the proposal.

One night, the soldiers notice Parthiban getting into the palace, and they reach Amutha's room. She makes him escape by making him wear Vikraman's costume. While leaving, he meets his mother, but pretends to be Vikraman. When he is talking to her, Vikraman arrives, and they scuffle.

Through the maidservant, the queen learns that Parthiban is also her son. She goes to the prison and orders his release. By then, Vikraman arrives with Naganathan, who confirms they are brothers, but states that the kingdom cannot afford to have two brothers fighting for power. Vikraman does not wish to share the kingdom and to avoid anyone recognising him, orders that Parthiban be masked and imprisoned. Parthiban has an iron mask locked on his face; its key is with Vikraman.

Amutha and Parthiban's friend Ponnan hatch a plan to rescue Parthiban. Amutha makes Vikraman insensibly drunk after a dance and takes the key. Parthiban's associates reach the prison, set him free, put the same on Vikraman's face and dump him in prison. Parthiban assumes charge of the kingdom and introduces citizen friendly policies which are welcomed by the people.

Naganathan suspects foul play. By then, Vikraman sends a message to Naganathan by writing on his dinner plate about Parthiban impersonating him.

R. Vijaya]],"There is a dispute between three goddesses about who is the most powerful of them all. [[Narada]], a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the argument by visiting [[Saraswati]], the goddess of knowledge, and annoys her on purpose by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. Angered, Saraswati states she will prove that knowledge is more important. Narada then goes to [[Vaikuntha]] to see [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth and says that knowledge is more abundant. Lakshmi retorts she will prove that wealth is more important. Narada finally goes to [[Mount Kailash]], seeking [[Parvati]], the goddess of strength, and annoys her by saying that wealth and knowledge are more important. Parvati stresses that strength is more important.

Each of the three Goddesses, having been turned against one another by Narada, decide to choose someone on earth and bless them with their respective powers so that each of them can prove their power is the most important and make the other two Goddesses lose. Saraswati blesses a [[Muteness|mute]] person, Vidyapati, by imparting to him all the knowledge in the world and bestows upon him the gift of speech. The king of Vidyapati's kingdom, Selvapuram, is dying and does not have any children. He orders his minister to send the royal Elephant into the streets with a garland and the person whose neck the Elephant puts the garland on will be his successor. Lakshmi makes the royal Elephant put the garland on a beggar girl, Selvambigai, thus making her wealthy. Parvati blesses Veeravallan, a man who has been a coward his whole life, with the gift of strength.

Vidyapati and Selvambigai happen to meet one another at a temple and get into a heated argument about their respective qualities bestowed on them. Vidyapati finds her too arrogant because of her wealth while Selvambigai finds him egotistical due to his knowledge and both leave the temple in a huff. Selvambigai thinks about her argument with Vidyapati and loses control over her horses. Veeravallan spots her and saves her from a near-fatal accident. Impressed with his bravery, she makes him the commander-in-chief of the kingdom's army. Selvambigai is impressed by Vidyapati's knowledge as well and decides to make him the kingdom's head poet as she feels his knowledge could be useful for the reputation of Selvapuram.

Selvambigai spends too much of her time engaging in a battle of wits with Vidyapati, which makes Veeravallan believe that she is neglecting her royal duties. He instigates his soldiers into rebellion and puts Vidyapati in prison. Selvambigai secretly goes to the prison and asks him to sing in her praise so as to guarantee his freedom; Vidyapati rejects the offer and instead sings in a manner that insults her. Veeravallan learns of the meeting and puts Selvambigai in prison, orders the execution of both her and Vidyapati, and declares himself Selvapuram's ruler. The Gods of the Holy Trinity, [[Shiva]] (Haranath), [[Vishnu]] (Sivakumar) and [[Brahma]] (Sarangkapani) settle the dispute by explaining the importance of knowledge, wealth, and strength combined, and how dangerous it is if each of them is bestowed on human beings separately. Finally, the three Goddesses reconcile and Vidyapati, Selvambigai and Veeravallan realise the importance of wealth, knowledge and strength."

Navarathri (1964 film),[[A. P. Nagarajan]],[[K. V. Mahadevan]],{{ubl|[[Sivaji Ganesan]]|[[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]]}},"The film opens with the narrator explaining that there are nine types of human behaviours ([[Navarasa|Navarasam]]) known as Wonder (Arputham), Fear (Bayam), Compassion (Karuna), Anger (Kobam), Equanimity (Saantham), Disgust (Aruvaruppu), Elegance (Singaram), Bravery (Veeram) and Bliss (Anandham) and that Sivaji Ganesan's nine roles represent one character per role. The story traces Nalina's experience of these nine emotions on nine consecutive nights.

Nalina is the only daughter of a rich man. When she happily celebrates [[Navaratri]] festival at her home with her friends, her father informs her that an arranged groom and the groom's parents will be visiting to check Nalina out for marriage.

'''''Second Night (Fear)''''': The next day she damages the vegetables of a vendor. When the vendor fights with her, she is rescued by a homely looking woman. The woman takes Nalina to her home. Nalina meets several women in her house. But the house is a brothel house. She is closeted with a drunkard, who justifies his actions that he cannot have relations with his own wife as she is a TB patient, and that, though he does not want to betray his wife, he is not able to resist his feelings. Nalina advises and warns him, but he does not want to hear it. After much struggle, the drunkard falls onto the floor and faints. Nalina escapes from the place.

'''''Third Night (Compassion)''''': After escaping from the brothel house, Nalina is caught by a patrol policeman for wandering into the road at unusual time. At the police station, she pretends to be a mentally ill woman. The police admit her at a mental hospital. The old aged lonely doctor Karunaagaran understands that Nalina is fine and is merely pretending in order to escape from cops, and so he helps her. She stays in the hospital the whole night. The next morning, the Doctor finds a newspaper with a 'missing' notice and a photograph of hers. Nalina escapes while the doctor is still looking at the newspaper.

'''''Fourth Night (Anger)''''': Nalina misunderstands that the police jeep is coming for her. She dashes towards a man with a gun and faints. The man takes her to his place. Nalina understands that the police are not looking for her, but looking for the man as he is a killer who killed a rich businessman as a revenge for his brother's death. The gunman insists that Nalina leave. But she doesn't as she feels he is a good person and convinces him to surrender to police. In an attack, the gunman is killed by the businessman's henchmen. Nalina escapes from the place.

'''''Fifth Night (Equanimity)''''': Fed up with life, Nalina runs onto a track to attempt suicide. An innocent villager, looks at her and rushes to the track to save her. He takes her to his house and introduces her to his elder sister. A local priest visits their home and tells them that Nalina is possessed by a spirit in order to cheat them of money by performing some fake rituals. Nalina gets irritated by their acts and escapes that night.

'''''Sixth Night (Disgust)''''': Nalina meets an old aged leper, who once upon a time was a rich man. The man lost all his money in the treatment and charity (hoping that will help him from disease). He is disgusted by everyone, including his own son, who abandoned him when his money ran out. Nalina helps him by taking him to a hospital. The doctor is surprised as he is one who benefited by a medicine degree by the charity of the rich man. The doctor decides to stay with him until he is cured. Nalina leaves the hospital.

'''''Seventh Night (Elegance)''''': Nalina feels very tired and asks for water from a house. People offer water to her. One of the men, Sathyavaan Singaaram, is a director and actor of stage plays and road side plays. Their troop had committed to stage nine plays in the village on the account of the Navaratri celebration. But the heroine had fallen sick and his whole troop are in critical position, in search of a replacement for the seventh day play, failing which will make them lose money and reputation in the village. He asks Nalina to help by acting with him for the day's play. Nalina agrees on a condition that she should be let go after the play is over. The play is successful that night. After the play, the troop's agent tries to misbehave with Nalina and the actor pulls him off and warns him. But he finds Nalina has left.

'''''Eight Night (Bravery)''''': Nalina disguises as a man and visits a house of a hunter Veerapan. The hunter is ostensibly hunting a man-eater. Nalina introduces herself as Nathan, a secret agent in search of a criminal. The hunter seems to believe her and gives her an earnest welcome, feast and hospitality. Nalina finds that the hunter is actually the commissioner of police in search of a criminal. She tries to escape from the place, but she is caught by the hunter.

The hunter introduces himself as the paternal uncle of the groom whom her father proposed for her and the groom is none other than her lover&nbsp;– Anand. Nalina has left her home before her father knew that she is in love with a person and the lover is the same man he has arranged for his daughter. Also Nalina misunderstands that Anand is going to marry another girl, but she ''is'' the girl. Nalina leaves for the Anand's place the ninth day.

'''''Ninth Day (Bliss)''''': Anand looks pale and dull after Nalina left her home. He is neither interested in living normally, nor in continuing with his studies. His parents are worried and scold him for wasting his life for a girl after all. Angered by this, he shuts himself into a room. Nalina reaches his home that time. Anand's parents and Nalina fear that he is attempting suicide. But suddenly the room opens and Nalina runs inside.

Anand wanted to surprise Nalina about their marriage and that is why he did not inform her about the engagement. Due to miscommunication, Nalina had left home on the first Navatri night and has come back on the ninth Navaratri night.

Anand and Nalina happily marry. Her wedding is attended by all the people she met during those days, except by the dead gunman of the fourth night."

Shankar meets Kannan; he offers Kannan a large amount of money so he can live prosperously but does not invite him to live with them. Kannan rejects the money, saying he is content to know his parents. Vijay comes and asks his father for money; Kannan, who is hiding in a cupboard, gestures Shankar to give the rejected money to Vijay.

In the meantime, Ananth wants more money from Vijay, so he kidnaps Vijay and demands a large ransom from Shankar. When Shankar is about to leave with the ransom money, Kannan asks to go instead. Shankar refuses so Kannan knocks him out and goes to the planned meeting disguised as Shankar. Kannan rescues Vijay and kills Ananth but is mortally wounded in the process. Shankar, Parvathi and the police arrive at the scene of the shooting. Kannan dies in the arms of his mother, who accepts him as her son."
Ambikapathy (1957 film),[[P. Neelakantan]],[[G. Ramanathan]],[[Sivaji Ganesan]]<br />[[P. Bhanumathi]],"[[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] is a poet in Kulothunga's court in [[Urayur]]. Despite his erudite scholarship, deep learning of Sanskrit and Tamil and extraordinary poetic skills, Kamban remains a humble, unassuming, deeply pious man, and a loyal subject of the King. All this earns Kamban a special place in the heart of Kulothunga who treats him with utmost deference and affection. Ottakoothar is another great poet in the King's court, and Kamban's ascent in the firmament and the King's unabashed admiration for Kamban's poetry has Ottakoothar simmering in jealousy.

It is in this backdrop that the love story blossoms. Amaravathi, the beautiful princess and Ambikapathy, the handsome and talented son of Kambar, fall in love. Ambikapathy is a bold, assertive and supremely self-confident youth, who even at that age, exhibits poetic skills equal to that of his illustrious father. [[Ottakoothar]] is doubly dismayed when he hears of this affair, for he had planned to bring about the marriage of Amaravathi with his stooge, Prince Kulasekharan of [[Vengi]]. With a brilliant, cunning mind at work, Ottakoothar sets about poisoning the King's mind against Ambikapathi and contrives to bring about various situations wherein Ambikapathi might fall to disgrace. Luck seems to be on Ambikapathi's side as he comes unscathed through these traps.

However, when Kamban discovers his son's love for the princess and realizes the gruesome retribution that would undoubtedly follow, he pleads with Ambikapathi to give up his love. Meanwhile, Ottakoothar gets possession of a verse that Ambikapathi had penned as an ode to Amaravathi's beauty and loses no time to showing the parchment to the King. The King is shaken by this clinching evidence of the love affair, and is determined to put it to an end. However, wishing to avoid any unwanted publicity and not willing to take any drastic measures, at the suggestion of Kamban, the King orders Ambikapathi to go to the distant Pushpaga Theevu, apparently to propagate the greatness of Tamil. A storm leads to the ship in which Ambikapathy is traveling being wrecked; and hanging on to a log, Ambikapathi is washed ashore in Shenbaga Theevu. Coming to know of the developments in Uraiyur, Ambikapathy hastens in disguise thereto.

With the help of Kannamma, the daughter of Pugazhendhi Pulavar, he succeeds in meeting Amaravathi, and they plan to flee to Shenbaga Theevu that night. But their plans go awry and both are caught trying to leave the palace. The King sentences Ambikapathy to death. But Amaravathi intervenes, claiming equal responsibility for whatever may have been the crime that Ambikapathi is said to have committed. In the ensuing argument, the King condemns Ambikapathi as sham poet who could write only verses that cater to man's baser instincts. Ambikapathy is outraged at this slur on his poetic capabilities. The upshot is that if Ambikapathi could sing 100 devotional songs in succession, the King promises him Amaravathi's hand in marriage. If he failed in this challenge, he would be executed forthwith. Amaravathi visits Ambikapathi in prison that night and urges caution. Ambikapathi laughs away her fears, assuring her that he is wholly confident of his own capabilities. A relieved Amaravathi says that she would be counting the songs, and would appear before him at the end of the ordeal.

The court assembles next day at the vasantha madapam, and in the august presence of the King, ministers and scholars, Ambikapathy commences his soiree with a short invocation to Saraswathi, the Goddess of learning. Amaravathi mistakenly counts this as one of the hundred songs, and so at the end of the 99th song, she appears happily in front of Ambikapathi to signal his victory. Overjoyed at sighting his beloved, and thinking that he has completed the hundred songs, Ambikapathy bursts into a verse in praise of Amaravathi's appearance. Rising with grim satisfaction, Ottakoothar points out that only 99 devotional songs had been sung, and hence Ambikapathy has lost the challenge. Kamban's anguish-filled plea for clemency falls on deaf ears, as the King orders the death sentence to be carried out. Ambikapathi is put to death, and the grief-stricken Amaravathi too dies and their souls unite in heaven."

Vedachalam is also secretly married to Sivakami and has a daughter Vijaya, by the second marriage. After Sivakami's death, his daughter decides to seek him out and sets out to Ooty to confront him with proofs of his second marriage.

Meanwhile, another Vijaya with the same name is the daughter of a wealthy zamindar. After her parents death, her uncle tries to marry her in order to acquire her wealth. Unwilling to marry him, she runs away from home. On the way to the railway station, her taxi runs over the first Vijaya. She tries to take her to the hospital, but the taxi driver refuses to help. Ravi who comes on the same road sees Vijaya and hospitalises her.

The second Vijaya reaches the railway station and realises that she has the first Vijaya's luggage. She opens the trunk and finds evidence of Vedachalam and Sivakami's wedding. Needing a place to stay, she decides to go to Vedachalam and claim that she is his daughter. She meets Ravi on the train and she pretends to be Vedachalam's daughter. Ravi is disturbed to know that his father had a second wife, but does not reveal his identity to her.

The second Vijaya meets Vedachalam and confronts him. He accepts the charges and introduces her to his wife and son as his friend's daughter. Vijaya also agrees to pretend to be his friend's daughter. Ravi initially accepts her claim, but later realises that she is not his real sister because his sister is left-handed while Vijaya is right-handed. She is forced to tell him the truth.

Initially, Ravi decides to throw her out but later tells her to continue acting as his sister in order to make his father admit to his deceipt and accept his real sister. Meanwhile, he falls in love with her and his mother accepts their relationship and want to get them married. Vedachalam is against this relationship since he believes that Vijaya is his daughter.

Having lost the proof of her birth, the now-recovered first Vijaya meets her boyfriend, Sundaram and seeks his help. Since his father is against love marriages, Sundaram puts her up temporarily in a hotel.

Tirupathy is Vedachalam's family physician and he sees a ""Missing"" advertisement placed by Vijaya's uncle and tries to find out who she is. Meanwhile, Ravi meets his real sister in the hotel with Sundaram. Being Sundaram's friend, he tries to help the couple without revealing his relationship with Vijaya. At his suggestion, Sundaram takes Vijaya home claiming that he ran over her and that she has lost her memory as a result of the accident.

Sundaram calls in Ravi who pretends to be a doctor and they convince Sundaram's father that if he does not help treat Vijaya, Sundaram will be jailed for the accident. So she stays in the house, and they give her a new name, Rathi. Since Ravi has to return to Ooty, Sundaram, his father and Rathi move there as well.

He also advises him to get his son married to Vijaya on the quiet since her father is much wealthier than him and may not agree to the marriage. Vijaya wants Ravi to attend the wedding but he says that he is having a registered marriage with Vijaya on that day.

Being anxious to get his son married to the wealthy Vijaya as soon as possible, Sundaram's father promises to conduct both weddings together at his expense.

During the construction of the [[Brihadisvara Temple|Brihadeswara Temple]] in Thanjavur, Emperor [[Rajaraja I|Rajaraja Cholan]] visits and is greeted by everyone except one sculptor who is deeply engrossed in his work. The emperor and empress then meet Karuvur Devar and are introduced to Tamizharasi, a poet and playwright. Rajaraja reveals that his son Rajendra, along with the Chola army, is helping the [[Eastern Chalukyas|Eastern Chalukya]] king of [[Vengi|Vengai]] Sakthivarman and his brother Vimalathithan reclaim their kingdom from [[Satyashraya|Satyasiriyan]].

As the army enters Satyasiriyan's palace, they find Bala Devar tied up, who claims he tried to stop the king from fighting but was ignored. Rajaraja, disguised as a soldier, identifies himself and appoints Bala Devar as his minister despite suspicions from others. He then announces to his noblemen that Bala Devar should be treated with the same respect as himself. Meanwhile, Bala Devar meets Poongodi from his village and shares his desire to overthrow Rajaraja. They plan together, and Bala Devar asks her to stay in the Chola capital. Rajaraja's daughter Kundavai is told by Rajendra that Vimalathithan has brought her a special gift.

Later, Rajaraja, along with his sister and Nambiyandar Nambi, goes to retrieve ancient scriptures from a temple in [[Chidambaram]], which are believed to be the works of saints [[Sambandar]], [[Appar]], and [[Sundarar]]. Despite initial skepticism, they find the scriptures in a hidden chamber with the help of golden statues of the saint-poets. Rajaraja emphasizes the eternal nature of the saint's works and their significance. Bala Devar allows Satyasiriyan into his house in the Chola capital through a secret passage where he is questioned about the Chola emperor and his son's potential marriage to Kundavai. Rajaraja scolds Vimalathithan for failing to pay his respects, defended by Vimalathithan. After a heated argument, Vimalathithan warns the emperor not to manipulate his daughter's love. Kundavai vows not to marry anyone who disrespects her father. Vimalathithan encounters Rajendran and warns him of Bala Devar's schemes. The emperor excludes Vengi and Vimalathithan from Kundavai's temple event, leading to tension and confrontation. Vimalathithan attends the event as a commoner and criticizes Kundavai's dance, angering Rajaraja. Vimalathithan warns the emperor against Bala Devar's influence and Rajaraja plans to attack Vengi. Rajendra refuses, leading to conflict within the royal family. The Chola army attacks Vengi, with Rajendran accepting the fight despite Vimalathithan's reluctance. Rajaraja intervenes as a sage, suggesting a duel between Rajendran and Vimalathithan, resulting in Rajendran's victory. Vimalathithan is imprisoned for speaking out against Bala Devar, inciting public unrest. Eventually, Kundavai convinces Rajaraja to release Vimalathithan, but only if Vengi makes unacceptable concessions. The story unfolds with betrayal, power struggles, and personal sacrifices within the Chola empire.

Satyasiriyan sends his guard Ottran to meet Bala Devar on Pournami day. However, Ottran is captured by Rajaraja, who assumes Ottran's identity. Bala Devar informs Rajaraja of a plan to poison him during a feast, with Poongodi aiding them. The plan is foiled when Rajaraja only drinks milk and fruits. Poongodi mixes poison in the milk, but Rajaraja reveals he knew of their plan and informs Bala Devar. Bala Devar pretends to be angry at Poongodi, who is later released along with other prisoners the next day. Rajaraja is praised by all the kings, and Vimalathithan is released. He asks for the emperor's daughter in marriage, leading to suspicion from Bala Devar. Rajaraja reveals Poongodi is a spy working for him, aware of Bala Devar's schemes. Tamizharasi finishes her notes and the two couples marry, with Rajaraja's cleverness and foresight ensuring the safety of the empire and his family."

The jewels are stored in the collectorate and only brought to the temple during the [[Chitra Pournami (festival)|Chithra Pournami]], after which they are returned to government custody. Pandiyan ""Pandi"", the village president, resides with his sister Meenatchi ""Meena"". He was previously engaged to Gowri but called off the wedding upon learning that his horoscope predicted his wife would die prematurely. Gowri, still devoted to Pandiyan, remains a significant part of his and Meenatchi's lives. Following the Chithra Pournami pooja, Ranjith intends to loot the jewels during their transit back to the collector's office. However, their attempt is foiled by Manimaaran, the son of Dharmalingam, the village landlord and Nanjappa's nephew. Nanjappa spreads false rumors about Manimaaran to his father, aiming to eliminate him and facilitate their future heist.

The trio is forced to wait until the next Chithra Pournami to steal. Meanwhile, Ranjith kidnaps an archaeological research officer responsible for discovering a subway path leading to the temple. The officer is later found dead, and the crucial palm leaf manuscript containing subway research goes missing, making Inspector Shankar investigate the murder, suspecting foul play. Shankar disguises himself as Postman Naidu and enters Manimangalam. Pandiyan has a long-standing feud with Dharmalingam, which Nanjappa and the Dharmakartha exacerbate by spreading misinformation about Pandiyan. Ranjith, disguised as a saint, enters the village, and Shankar identifies him but remains unaware of their plan to loot the jewels. Ranjith, with the dharmakartha's assistance, discovers the entrance to the hidden temple subway. Further exploration reveals that the underground subway terminates at the cremation site of Pandiyan's mother.

Ranjith disguised as a saint, requests that Pandiyan donate his land, but Pandiyan refuses. Meanwhile, Manimaaran foils an attempt by Dharmakartha's son-in-law to loot farm produce from the temple land and reports the incident to Pandiyan. Pandiyan orders public humiliation as punishment, infuriating Dharmakartha. After some initial comedic encounters, Meena develops feelings for Manimaaran. Nanjappa conspires to tarnish Pandiyan's reputation by orchestrating a false accusation of rape against him, using Sweety as the accuser. However, Postman Naidu, informs Manimaaran about the plot, and Gowri and Manimaaran intervene to resolve the issue. Undeterred, Nanjappa and his cohorts kidnap Meena, but Manimaaran rescues her after receiving information from Gowri. However, in the ensuing chaos, Pandiyan chops off Ranjith's hand without realizing his true identity. Shankar suspects that the severed hand belongs to Ranjith and orders a lab test to confirm.

Nanjappa informs Pandiyan about Meena's romantic relationship with Manimaaran, angering Pandiyan, who confronts Meena. Manimaaran's mother requests that her son marry Meena, and Pandiyan, moved by the request, agrees. However, Dharmalingam refuses to accept the union, prompting Manimaaran and Meena to get married regardless of his objections. Nanjappa exploits the conflict to his advantage, orchestrating an attack on Pandiyan and deceiving him into believing Dharmalingam was responsible. However, Pandiyan and Dharmalingam eventually reconcile, only for Nanjappa to devise a plan to kill Dharmalingam and frame Pandiyan for the crime. As planned, Nanjappa murders Dharmalingam and manipulates the situation to get Pandiyan arrested. Trusting Nanjappa's deceit, Manimaaran becomes enraged with Pandiyan and Meena. Meanwhile, Shankar's investigation reveals Nanjappa's culpability in Dharmalingam's murder. Pandiyan escapes from prison, and Manimaaran confronts him, believing he killed his father. However, Shankar intervenes, revealing the truth about Nanjappa's involvement. Manimaaran and Pandiyan reunite, determined to prevent Nanjappa's plan to steal the temple jewels.

On Chithra Pournami day, Ranjith, Nanjappa, and Dharmakartha attempt to loot the jewels. With the help of Kannaiya, Gowri, and Meena, Ranjith's henchmen are arrested outside the temple. Manimaaran thwarts Ranjith's escape plan, and a fierce battle ensues between Manimaaran, Pandiyan, Shankar, and Ranjith's henchmen. Finally, Nanjappa dies in a subway collapse, and Dharmakartha succumbs to a snake bite. Meanwhile, Gowri feigns fatal injuries, prompting Pandiyan to marry her in a heartfelt ceremony."

The wedding takes place and Sulochana becomes a loving wife and the perfect home-maker because she is very traditional and she builds the family including all the mother's love for Vasudevan. The house was like ""house for ghosts"" because there was no wife and mother until now, but now Sulochana starts everything perfectly, regular puja, Tulsi, rangoli, toranam above door, keeping two cows, cooking proper food at proper time, lunchbox for Vasudevan, waiting for each other to come home, celebrating all the small and big festivals, keeping all the Nomu (Vrath) with fasting and feasting, and everything like that. For Vasudevan, she is the only mother he ever knew and he fully accepts her as his own mother. Sulochana gets pregnant and delivers a baby boy, but the delivery is very difficult and the baby boy is born dead. The doctor tells Karunakaran that Sulochana will not have any more children because the delivery was complicated and he had to cut some organ to save her life. When Sulochana hears of this, she is very sad, but noble lady, and she says, ""God gave me one sweet son. Why I should ask more?"" and she pats Vasudevan lovingly on the head.

Time rolls on and Vasudevan becomes as an adult and becomes a college professor, but unfortunately, Karunakaran and Sulochana was not blessed with children. Vasudevan presents Sulochana gold bangles from his first pay. Vasudevan was arranged to marry [[Rao Bahadur]] Ponnambalam's and Akilam's daughter Prabha.

Comic relief was presented in a moral story of Ponnambalam's family. Ponnambalam listens too much to and often quarrels with Akilam. This drives Ponnambalam's son Kalamani ([[K. A. Thangavelu]]) and his wife Neela ([[Ragini (actress)|Ragini]]) to hatch a drama in order for Ponnambalam and Akilam to be united and respect each other. Kalamani and Neela succeed in this.

Prabha's character was the opposite of Sulochana's, but the latter hardly bothers about this and carries on her daily good deeds. Prabha gets pregnant and delivers a baby boy, Ravi (Master Ravi), but she does not care much for him. Sulochana picks up the tasks and takes care of Ravi as a mother should. As Ravi grows, Prabha does not like this and forbids Sulochana from raising Ravi.

Ravi falls ill due to the separation and Sulochana takes care of him day and night, not bothering about her meals and health. Ravi becomes very serious for a month, till the doctor who treats him loses hope. Sulochana takes Ravi to a temple and pleads to Lord Shiva to take her life instead and spare Ravi's life. Prabha apologises to Sulochana, but the latter says that it was by the God's grace before collapsing due to being too weak. Even on her death bed, Sulochana enquires about Ravi's health. After thanking Karunakaran and Vasudevan for a good life as a daughter-in-law in the house and says that she would be reborn in this house, Sulochana dies.

Sulochana's body was cremated, but Karunakaran and Vasudevan were surprised to see the gold bangles were not damaged during the process. A baby girl was born on the exact day after a year and she was accepted by the whole family as Sulochana reborn. The gold bangles would be worn to her on every birthday, thus the special occasion."

He has a dimwit son, Varadhukutty who is considered an idiot on account of his inability to get a job after passing his SSLC. He is constantly requesting his manager to somehow get his son a government job. The manager says that if Varadukkutty can clear the [[Public service commissions in India|Public Service Commission]] exams, he will fetch a job in the same office where Narashimaachaari is working. After questioning Varadhukutty, the manager says that Varadukkutty can't clear the exam and sarcastically says that maybe he can pass only if the question paper is leaked.

Narashimaachari has rented out a part of his house to Ragothama Rao's family, where Varathikutty falls in love with Rao's daughter, Jayanthi. She too reciprocates due to the innocence and good-heartedness of Varadhukutty. Narashimaachari goes to the extent of buying the leaked question papers from his corrupt office colleague, Anantharaman ahead of time leaving his principles and self-respect in an attempt to get his son through but Narashimaachari gets caught redhanded before the Manager and his office colleagues. He takes a six-month leave from work, vowing to make his son a top student through his efforts and prepare him for the exam somehow honestly. He and Jayanthi work together to make Varadhu study for the exam and succeed in the endeavour. While leaving for the examination hall, he dies in a sudden, high-speed run car accident. The car driver could not be identified as there was no number plate on the car, but the bystanders around identify the one sitting next to the car driver was wearing a white scarf with a blue cross on it. Narashimaachari was looking and waiting to kill the person who killed his son by car. His wife, Vedha becomes mentally ill due to it.

One year later, Anand, a look-alike of Varadhukutty and a thief cum rowdy is chased by a group of people who coincidentally hide in the house of Narashimaachari. His wife Varadhu, immediately recognises Anand as her son, and hence, Narashimaachari requests him to play as his son to cure his wife. Anand reluctantly agrees as he is temporarily on the run from the police. The love from Narashimaachari eventually makes Anand turn into a good guy and also quit drinking and smoking.

A few days later, Anand's friend Samuel visits him to inform him about the new theft. But, Anand rejects and tells Samuel that he is now a new person and not involved in any such activities. In a conversation with Ragothama Rao and Samuel, Anand realises that it was he who ran the car over Varadhukutty, which is overheard by Vedha. Vedha reveals that she already knew that Anand was not her son. Anand now feeling guilty, says that he would tell the truth to Narashimaachari and accept whatever punishment given by him. Narashimaachari is not able to harm Anand, as his face reminds him of Varadhukutty. Both, Narashimaachari and Vedha adopt as well as accept Anand as their son. Anand wants to fulfill his father's dream of clearing the exam and getting a job. While leaving for the examination hall, in a twist of fate, Anand dies in an overcrowded bus accident, leaving Narashimaachari and Vedha devastated."

He believes nonviolence & humanity are more significant than caste & clans and craves his son on the same path. Bharadwaja attains the highest power corridor as a chieftain to a religious organization ''Viswachaitanya Gurukulapeetam''. Parallelly, malicious Zamindar Bhupati Rayudu sublets authority over the lands under the ''Peetam'' by trampling tribes under his feet. Knowing it, Bharadwaja seizes his tyrant and allows the lands of the tribes. So, flared up, Bhupati decided to malice Bharadwaj and clamp Deeshithulu, the committee member.

Meanwhile, Bharadwaja takes debt from a lender, Narahari, to perform Jahnavi's marriage when Bhupati clutches Narahari. At the same time, Inspector Sampath Kumar, the henchman of Bhupati, molests Manga, daughter of Bharadwaja's aide Srisailam. Here, Bharadwaja files a case, but the malefactor acquits with fake alibis, and by that time, Manga is pregnant. Simultaneously, Bharadwaja's elder daughter, Gayatri, conceives when her father-in-law, Govardhanam, warns her to return with his heir. Both of them deliver at once, but unfortunately, Gayatri miscarries when panicked Brahmaramba secretly replaces Manga's child. After that, she divulges the reality to Bharadwaja and pleads for pardon. Being conscious of it, Bhupati conspires, which makes Govardhanam furious, who evades Gayatri and Jahnavi, whom her in-laws also neck out.

Right now, Deeshithulu inflames and accuses Bharadwaja of contradicting the religion. Moreover, Bhupati ruses by indicting him for theft using Narahari, for which he is ostracized. Overhearing it, Manga steps to proclaim the actuality, but she is slain when Bharadwaja adopts her orphan child. Howbeit enraged, Kaali revolts against Narahari and is sentenced. In prison, he is accountable for Chaitanya, a victim of Bhupati's cruelty. Before dying, he inspires and entrusts his responsibility to Kaali. Soon after his release, Bharadwaja learns the aim of Kaali when a rift arises between father & son, which makes Kaali leave the house. After that, Kaali mingles with the tribes and confronts Bhupati. In that process, he meets his love, Usha, the daughter of Bhupati's brother. After identifying the factuality, she, too, conjoins him.

Further, Kaali set rights for his sisters' families. After that, he kidnaps Narahari to uncover the truth. Exploiting it, Bhupati kills him and criminates Kaali. Eventually, he triggers Bharadwaja and makes him encounter Kaali, where he understands his son's virtue. Suddenly, Bhupati attacks them, in which Bharadwaja is seriously injured. Hence, they abscond. Accordingly, Bhupati captures Bharadwaja's daughters and slaughters the baby. Spotting it, Kaali bursts out. At last, Bharadwaja loses his patience, deviates from his path, and eliminates Bhupati. Finally, Bharadwaja affirms Kaali that he must live for the welfare of society."
